m The French Government at Vichy has repeatedly declered
its determination to resist all encroachments upon the
sovercignty of its territories, However, the German and
Italian forces availed themselves of certain facilities in
Syria to cerry on operations directed against the British,
the French Government, although this was a plain encroach-
ment on territory under French control, did not resist,

But when the British undertook defense operations in the
territory of Syria, the French Government did resist,

"Under these circumstances, this Government is impelled
to question whetaer the French Government at Vichy in fect
proposes to maintain its declered policy to preserve for
the French people the territories both at home and abroad
which have long been under French sovereignty.

"This Government, mindful of its traditional friend-
ship for Frence, has deeply s}mpathized with the desire of
the French people to maintain their territories and to
preserve them intact. In its relations with the French

-Governnent at Vichy end with the lccal French authorities
in French territories, the United States will be governed
by the manifest effectiveness with which those authorities
endeavor to protect these territories from domination and
control by those powers which are seeking to extend their
rule by force and conquest, or by the threat thereof,"
