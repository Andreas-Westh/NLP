THE PRESIDENT said he was 100% in agreement
with Marshal Stalin and remarked that after 100 years
of French rule in Indo-China, tne inhabitants were
worse off than they had been vefore. He said that

' Chiang Kai Shek had told him China had no designs

on Indo-China but the people of Indo-China were not
yet ready for independence, to which he had replied

â€˜that when the United States acquired the Philippines,

the inhabitants were not ready for indenendence
which would be granted without qualification upon
the end of the war against Japan. He added that
he had discussed with Chieng Kai Shek the possi-
bility of a system of trusteeship for Indo-China
which would have the task of preparing the people
for independence within a definite period of time,
perhaps 20 to 50 years.

MARSHAL STALIN completely agreed with this
view.
