The action of -the Japanese Government in tearing
away the veil with which it for so lon, attempted to
Cloak its dominetion of Indo-CGhine is a direct conse-
quence of the ever-mountinj; pressure which our arms
are epplying to the Japansse Zinvire. It is Â«& link in
the chain of events which bezan so disastrously in the
summer of 191 with the Frenco-Japanese esreement for
the "common defense" of Indo-Chins. It is clear that
this latest step in the Japanese progrem will in the
long run prove to be of no avail. ; ji

The Provisionel Government of the French tiepublic
has requested armed essistanes for those who ave resist-
ing the Japenese forces in indo-Chins. In accordance
with its constant desire to aid 211 those who are willing
to take up erns against our comuon enemies, this Govern-
ment will do all it can to be of assistence in the present
situation, consistent with plans to thich it is already
committed and with the operations now taking place in the
Pacific. It goes rithout sayings that ell this country's
available resources are bein; devoted to the defsat of
our enemies snd they will continue to be employed in the
manner best calculated to hasten their downfall.
