At the request of the Jepanese Anbassaéor, the President
received the Ambassador for an off- the-record conference in the Oval
Room at the White House at five o'clock this afternoon, At the
President's request, Acmiral Stark and I were present,

The President then went on to say that this new move by Japan
in Indochina created an exceedingly serious problem for the United
States, Ee saic that, as I had stated to the Ambessador yesterday,
inscfar eas assuring itseif thav it could obtain foodstuffs and raw
materials from Indochina, Japan, of course, had it reached an agree-
ment with tne United States along the ters of the discussions be-
ytween Secretary Hull and the Anbassadcer, would have been afforded far
greater assurances of obtaining such supolies than any other nation,
More than that, the President seid, the cost of any military occunation
is tremendous end the occupation itself is not conductive to the >
production by civilians in occupied countries of food supplies and rew
materials of the character required by Japan, Had Japan undertaken to
obtain the supplies she required from Indochina in a peaceful war,
she not only would have obtained larger quantities of such supplies,
but would have obtained them with complete security and without the
draining expense of a military occupation. Furthermore, from the
military standpoint, the President said, surely the Japanese Govern-
ment could not have in reality the slishtest belief that Chine, Great
Britain, the Netherlands or the United States had any territorial
designs on Indochina nor were in the slightest degree providing any
reel threats of aggression against Japan. This Government, consequently,
could only assume that the occupation of Indochine was being underteken
by Japan for the purpose of furthér offense and this created a situation
which necessarily must give the United States the most serious disquite.

The President seid that he had been following in complete detail
‘the conversations which had been progressing between Secretar; Hull
and th Ambassador and that he was confident that the Ambassador would
agree that the policies not undertaken in Indochina by the Japanese
Government vere cornbleteliy opposed to the principles and ‘te letter
of the proposed agreement which bad been under discussion,
