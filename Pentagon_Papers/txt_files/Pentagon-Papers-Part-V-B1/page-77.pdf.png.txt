With reference to the attached
despatch from Chungking, I fear that there
4s a lump in the General's mashed potatoes.
I feather that he speaks his mind to the
‘pepresentatives of the "imperialistic
powers" and then announces that he is not
responsible for our policy. All in all
it strikes me as a rather extraordinary
performance.

The attached note from the French is
also an extraordinary document for one
Embassy to deliver to another.
