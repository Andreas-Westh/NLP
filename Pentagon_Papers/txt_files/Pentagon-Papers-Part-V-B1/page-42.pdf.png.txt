DISCUSSIONS REGARDING THE FUTURE STATUS OF FRENCH INDO-
CHINA AND FRENCH PARTICIPATION IN ITS LIBERATION FROM
JAPANESE OCCUPATION

Memorandum by the Secretary of State to President Roosevelt *

Wasutnectoy, January 14, 1944.
Last week in a conversation ** which I had with the British Am-
bassador he stated that, according to information from his Foreign
Office, you had spoken rather definitely during your recent trip of
your views concerning the future of French Indo-China. According
to Lord Halifax’ information you had expressed the opinion that
Indo-China should be taken away from the French and administered
by an international trusteeship.* He wondered whether this repre-
sented your final conclusions and attached importance to the matter
in view of the fact that reports of your alleged conversations would
undoubtedly get back to the French. I informed the Ambassador that
I did not know whether you had come to any final conclusions on the
subject and added that, in my judgment, you and Mr. Churchill would
find it desirable to talk this matter over fully, deliberately, and per-
haps finally at some future stage.

under a trusteeship until it was ready for independence.
