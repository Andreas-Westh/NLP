Tt is clear that a continuance of such a situation is un-
thinkable.

; None of the peoples whom I have spoken of above can sit either
indefinitely or permanently on a keg of dynomite.

There is absoluteely no thought on the part of the United States
of invading Indo-China if every Japanese soldier or sailor were to be
withdrawn therefron.

I think that we can obtain the same assurance fron the
Governments of the East Indies, the Governments of Maleya and the
Government of Thailend., I would even undertake to ask for the sare
assurence on the part of the Government of China. Thus a withdrawel
of the Japanese forces from Indo-China would result in the assurance
of peace throughout the whole of the South Pacific area,
