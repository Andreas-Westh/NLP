" TEHRAN CONFERENCE

Extract from Memorandum of Conversation
between President Roosevelt and Marshal Stalin,
Novenber 28, 1943, 3 p.m.1

MARSHAL STALIN expatiated at length on the French
ruling classes and he said, in his opinion, they
should not be entitled to share in any of the benefits
of the peace, in view of their past record of col-
laboration with Germany.

THE PRESIDENT said that Mr. Churchill was of
the opinion that France would be very quickly recon-
structed as a strong nation, but he did not person-
ally share this view since ne felt tnat many years
of honest labor would be necessary before France
would be re-established. He said the first necessity
for the French, not only for the Government but the
people as well, was to become honest citizens,

MARSHAL STALIN agreed and went on to say that
he did not propose to have the Allies shed blood
to restore Indo-China, for example, to the old Z
French colonial rule. He said that the recent .
events in the Lebanon made public service the first
step toward the independence of people who had
formerly been colonial subdjects. He said that in
the war against Japan, in his opinion, that in
addition to military missions, it was necessary to
fight the Japanese in the political sphere as well,
particularly in view of the fact that the Japanese
had granted the least nominal independence to cer-
tain colonial areas. He repeated that France should
not get back Indo-China and that the French must
pay for their criminal collaboration with Germany.
