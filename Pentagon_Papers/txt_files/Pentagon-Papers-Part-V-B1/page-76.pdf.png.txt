YALTA CONFERENCE

Extract from Memorandum of Conversation
between President Poosevelt and
Marshal Stalin, Livadia Palace,

February 8, 1945, 3:45 p.m.

THE PRESIDENT then said he also had in mind a
trusteeshin for Indochina. He added that the
British did not approve of this idea as they wished
to give it back to the French since they feared
the implications of a trusteeship as it might
affect Burma.

MARSHAL STALIN remarked that the British had
lost Burma once through reliance on Indochina,
md it was not his opinion that Britain was a
sure country to protect thisarea. He added
that he thought Indochina was a very important area.

THE PRESIDENT said that the Indochinese
were people of small stature, like tne Javanese
and Burmese, and were not warlike. He added that
France had done nothing to improve the natives
since she had the colony. He said that General
de Gaulle had asked for ships to transport French
forces to Indochina.

MARSHAL STALIN inquired where de Gaulle was
going to get the troops.

THE PRESIDENT replied that de Gaulle seid he
was going to find the troops when the President
could find the ships, but the President added that up
to the present he had been unable to find the ships.
