At this point the Ambassador took out of his pocket two sheets of
notes which he had prepared and asked the President's permission to
refer to them in order to make a statement of his Government's
position,

In this exposition the fmbassador covered exactly the same ground
witich he had covered in his conversation with me last night, .

The only points of difference were that at the outset of the
conversation, the jmbassador very clearly and emphatically steted
that the move by Japan into Indochina was something shich he
personally deplored and with which he personally was not in agreement, _

The President then said thet he had a proposal to make to the
imbassador which had occurred to him just before the fmbassador had come
in and which he had not had time to talk over with me before making
his proposal to the smbassador,

The President said thet it might be too late for him to make this
proposal but he felt that no matter how late the hour might be, he
still wished to seize every possible opportunity of preventing the
creation of a situation between Japan end the United States which could
only give rise to serious misunderstandings between the two peoples, .
The President stated that if the Japanese Government would refrain from
occupying Indochina with its military and neval forces, or, had such
steps actually been commenced, if the Japanese Government would
withdraw such forces, the President could assure the Japanese
Government that he would do everything within his power to obtainfrom
the Governments of China, Great Britain, the Netherlands, and of
course the United States itself a binding and solemn declaration,
provided Japan would undertake the same commitment, to regard
Indochina as a neutralized country in the same way in which Switzerland
had up to now been regarded by the powers as a neutralized cowmtry,

He stated that this wuld imly tha none of the powers concerned
would undertake my military act of aggression against Indochina and
would remain in control of the territory end would not be confronted
with attempts to dislodge them on the part of de Gaullist or Free
French agents or forces,
