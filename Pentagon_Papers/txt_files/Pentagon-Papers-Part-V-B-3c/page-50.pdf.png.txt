New information which has just come to my attention makes mo ~
feel that it is imperative to obtain concurrence or acquiesc-
ence of Schumann and Bldault prior to publication of statemondv.-
on Indochina. When Joyce showed proposed statement to Margorie,

“Margerie commented tha’ tho record seemed to be accurate as far
as it went but that 1t omltbted all montion of your offer of
atomlc bombs to Bidault. He sald you had made this offer to.
Bidault during a private conversation which took place during” “i

an intermission of one of the formal talks at the Quai d'Orsay,
which were held during your visit here on route to Geneva.

Joyce asked Margerie if this "offer" was not perhaps merely a ~
> speculation as to whether atomic bombs could be useful at Dien
Bien Phu. Margerie said "No". He further said that Bidault

told him and La Tournelle. about your offer immediately after_he he
finished talking with you and that Bidault had the distinct
impression that you were Suggesting the use of atomt¢ bombs
which were to be given by the US to the French. According to
Margerie Bidault was much upset about this offer and felt that
the use of atomic bombs would have done no good tactically and
would have lost all support for the-west throughout Asia v Our
judgment is that Margerie fears that if Bidault should feel
that publication of the statement as drafted placed him ir.
unfavorable light and indicated that he favored continuation of
the fighting and was not doing his best to obtain a settlement,
he might respond by publicizing his version of the conversation
