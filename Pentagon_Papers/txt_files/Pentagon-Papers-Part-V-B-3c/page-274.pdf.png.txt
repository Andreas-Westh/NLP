Associated States, with full independence within the French Union. The
French Union is an ultra-national, commonwealth-type arrangement, as yet
loosely defined and subject to further legal development. The statements
of French leaders to the effect that "France intends to maintain its presence
in the Far East" allude to the concept of the French Union. Further, the
French are capable of negating U.S. programs by: (a) working to bring
about the downfall of the Diem Government through an internal coup or
through influencing Bao Dai to dismiss Diem; (b) refusing to cooperate
in the training of the Vietnamese Army; (c) withdrawing completely from
Indochina, thus forcing the U.S. to increase substantially its political,
financial and military commitments in the area; (d) unilaterally reaching
a rapproachement with the Viet-Minh; and (e) insisting on executing their
obligations under the Geneva Agreement by pomeing towards holding the
‘elections now scheduled for July, 1956.

The basic factors on French policy with regard to Indochina are
as follows:

(a) The French desire to maintain a maximum of influence in Indochina,

(b) The French believe: because of their financial investment and
their historical position in Indochina, that their interests should be the
determining factor in political developments in Indochina and they are
Jealous of what they regard as U.S. intervention.

(c) French acceptance of the Geneva Accords recognized their military
inability to defeat the Viet-Minh, and the consequent need for a political
settlement of the Indochina problem on a basis which would minimize French

political, commercial, “arid prestige losses resulting from such a settlement.
