m"The size and composition of the forces of each of the Associated
States should be dictated by the local military requirements and the
over-all U.S. interests."

I am in general agreement with the views of the Joint Chiefs of.
Staff which represent the current Department of Defense position on this

subject.

A point additional to those made by the Joint Chiefs of Steff is
that international interpretation of the cease-fire agreement may in
any event impose limitations on the extent of military training, és well
as end~item assistance, that could be undertaken by the United States
in Indochina.

Sincerely yours,
