SENT TO: Amembassy SAIGON NIACT 4438 Apr 9 1955

EYES ONLY AMBASSADOR FROM SECRETARY ,
| Have this morning discussed situation with highest authority. We

are disposed to back whatever your final decision is but before you

a‘ tually finalize we want to be sure you have -weighed all of the factors

which concern us here. o
} We feel that what has happened does not reveal anything new about
tiem but rather a basic and dangerous misunderstanding as between France

and the U.S.
We have always known the qualities which Diem possesses and those
which he lacks. Nevertheless our two countries agreed to support him in

|
default of anyone possessing better qualifications. The only alternatives

now suggested are the same persons who were regarded as unacceptable sub-

stitutes some months ago.

What has happened is thet whereas the United States has been pro-
ceeding on the assumption thet Dien would be backed as against any who
might challenge him assuming that he had the capability, apparently the
French have given their support only on the assuiption that the Binh Xuyen
vould also be supported on an autonomous authority and that when they
challenged Dien he would not be allowed to use force to assert his enemies
over it. .

We can appreciate the reluctance of the French to see force used but
if it cannot be_used then what is the point of our supporting at great cost
the national army which I thought it had been agreed was primarily to be

an army for domestic security rether than an army to fight external ageression,
