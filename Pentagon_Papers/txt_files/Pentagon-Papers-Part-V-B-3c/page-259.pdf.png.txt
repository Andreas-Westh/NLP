I URGED ELY NOT DISCOUNT SOLUTION UNLESS VIETNAMESE THEMSELVES
REJECT IT, ELY REPEATED THAT DIEM REMAINS IN POWER ONLY

BY OUR INTERVENTION. I SAID IF HIS ANALYSIS WAS CORRECT,

AN ASSEMBLY WOULD VOTE DIEM OUT, AND IF AN ASSEMBLY DID SO,

I BELIEVED U.S. WOULD ACCEPT DECISION. ELY SAID HE KNEW HE
COULD NOT PROVE HIS STATEMENT, BUT HE BELIEVED THAT TO MAINTAIN
DIEM AGAINST POPULAR WILL WOULD BE TO DIMINISH VALIDITY OF
EXPRESSION OF POPULAR WILL WHEN ELECTIONS BECOME POSSIBLE.

I SAID THAT, ON CONTRARY, MODIFIED THOAT PROPOSAL WOULD

WORK ONLY IF ACCEPTED BY CONSIDERABLE BODY OF VIETNAMESE
OPINION. (#) BAO DAI IS FRANCO-U.S. CHOICE. I SAID I DID
NOT KNOW WHETHER PROPOSAL WOULD WORK, THAT I INTENDED TO

HAVE FURTHER CONSULTATIONS TODAY AND ONLY ASKED ELY NOT TO
PREJUDGE OUTCOME. ELY SAID THAT, IN HIS VIEW, NO SOLUTION
COULD APPEAR TO BE MORE MARKED AS FRANCO-U.S. SOLUTION THAN
MAINTENANCE OF DIEM. I SAID I COULD NOT AGREE WITH THIS

SINCE PLAN WOULD NOT WORK UNLESS GOOD MANY VIETNAMESE AGREED
TO TT.

8. ELY SAID THAT HE MUST MARK THIS AS A POINT OF DISAGREEMENT
BETWEEN US SINCE IF PLAN DID WORK IT WOULD BE BECAUSE OF MY
PUTTING PRESSURE ON VIETNAMESE, I AGREED THAT THOAI PROPOSAL,
AS MODIFIED, WOULD WORK ONLY IF U.S. AND FRANCE BACKED IT,

AND IF THE BASIC ELEMENTS WERE AGREED TO BY DIEM, DO, QUAT

ET AL AND BY BINH XUYEN, I REMINDED HIM WASHINGTON HAD NOT
YET AGREED TO WITHDRAW SUPPORT FROM DIEM, AND THAT IF IT DiD
AGREE TO WITHDRAW SUPPORT, SUCH WITHDRAWAL WOULD BE VERY

HARD FOR SECRETARY AND ME TO EXPLATN TO AMERICAN PEOPLE.

ELY SATD HE WAS UNABLE TO SEE HOW ANYONE WAS JUSTIFIED IN
MAINTAINING DIEM IN OFFICE AGAINST BEST JUDGMENT OF PEOPLE

ON THE SPOT. WITH RESPECT TO POSSIBLE WORKING OUT OF PROPOSAL,
I TOLD ELY MY GUESS WOULD BE THAT PROVISIONAL ASSEMBLY WOULD
VOTE DIEM OUT OF OFFICE UNLESS HE HAD BEEN BROUGHT TO CHANGE
HIS METHODS OF OPERATION. ELY SAID THIS WAS A DIFFERENCE

OF POINT OF VIEW BETWEEN US, EXPLAINED BY FACT THAT HE HAS
SPECIAL RESPONSIBILITIES WITH RESPECT TO CRISIS WHICH HE
FEELS CANNOT BE SOLVED AS LONG AS DIEM IS IN OFFICE, HE SAID
SITUATION IS GETTING WORSE DATLY, AND HE ATTRIBUTES THIS
WHOLLY TO DIEM'S INFLUENCE, SITUATION IS WORSENING IN THE
CENTER, AND UNDERGROUND IS GROWING. ONLY BY SURGERY, THAT

IS REMOVAL OF DIEM, CAN COUNTRY BE SAVED. I SAID I DI) NOT

BELIEVE
