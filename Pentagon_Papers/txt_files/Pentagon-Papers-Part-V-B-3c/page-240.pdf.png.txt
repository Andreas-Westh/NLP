FOR SECRETARY FROM COLLINS.

TEPARTMENT TELEGRAMS 4411 and 4412.

HIS MESSAGE IN TWO PARTS. PART I FOLLOWS.

PART I. SUCCESSIVE STEPS RECOMMENDED AS FOLLOWS:

1. TRANSFER NATIONAL POLICE AND SURETE FROM BINH XUYEN.
TWO POSSIBLE METHODS OF DOING THIS DEPENDING ON WHETHER
OBJECTIVE IS TO SAVE FACE FOR DIEM OR BINH XUYEN, POINT
ABOUT LATTER BEING TO SECURE THEIR PEACEFUL COOPERATION
WITH NEW GOVERNMENT,

A. TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR DIEM TO RESIGN AND PREVENT BINH
XUYEN FROM CLAIMING VICTORY IN PRESENT CRISIS, WE WOULD INSIST
AS PRIOR CONDITION ON TRANSFER OF POLICE TO GOVERNMENT BY :
ORDINANCE ISSUED BY DIEM, BUT OPENLY SUPPORTED BY BAO DAT

AND POSSIBLY FRENCH AND U.S. JUBLIC SUPPORT BY BAO DAT
PROBABLY ESSENTIAL TO AVOID FURTHER BLOODSHED. IN THIS CASE
BINH XUYEN MIGHT BE FORCED TO BOW BUT MIGHT TRY TO SABOTAGE
NEW GOVERNMENT IN VARIETY OF WAYS. (I SHOULD NOTE THAT
FRENCH WILL OPPOSE THIS STEP, ALTHOUGH HE ONCE FAVORED IT,
ELY HAS NOW SAID HE COULD NOT AGREE TO IT. FRENCH FEAR
BLOODSHED IF BINH XUYEN LOSE CONTROL OF POLICE UNDER DIEM

AND BELIEVE NEW PRIME MINISTER SHOULD HAVE POLITICAL ADVANTAGE
OF REGAINING CONTROL OF POLICE FOR GOVERNMENT).

B. IN ORDER INDUCE COOPERATION OF BINH XUYEN WITH NEW
GOVERNMENT, IT MIGHT BE ADVISABLE TO OFFER BAY VIEN A CHANCE
TO SAVE FACE BY HIS "VOLUNTARILY" PROPOSING THAT CONTROL

OF POLICE BE TRANSFERRED TO NEW GOVERNMENT. I HAVE JUST HAD
CONVERSATION WITH FOREIGN MINISTER DO, WITHOUT INDICATING
