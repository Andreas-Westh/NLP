OUR POSSIBLE THINKING, I ASKED DO IF HE THOUGHT BAY VIEN MIGHT
RELINQUISH POLICE CONTROLS TO ANY NEW GOVERNMENT. DO SAID .
HE FELT THAT WITH PROPER APPROACH, THIS MIGHT WELL BE POSSIBLE,
HE INSISTS IT WOULD NOT BE POSSIBLE FOR DIEM TO ACHIEVE THIS.
DO FULLY AGREES THAT ANY NEW GOVERNMENT WOULD HAVE TO TAKE
OVER POLICE CONTROLS, BUT FEELS STRONGLY THAT EVERYTHING
POSSIBLE SHOULD BE DONE TO SECURE COOPERATION OF BINH XUYEN
WITH NEW GOVERNMENT. I BELIEVE THAT IF BAY VIEN WERE CONVINCED
AHEAD OF TIME THAT U.S., FRANCE, BAO DAT AND ANY NEW PREMIER |
WOULD INSIST ON GOVERNMENT TAKING OVER POLICE, HE MIGHT WELL
AGREE TO MAKE THIS OFFER HIMSELF. I BELIEVE THIS METHOD
PREFERABLE TO 1A ABOVE UNLESS WASHINGTON FEELS DIEM'S PRESTIGE
AND PERHAPS OUR OWN MUST BE PROTECTED BY FOLLOWING METHOL

1A.

2. PERSUADE DIEM TO RESIGN, OR IF HE REFUSES, HAVE BAO DAL
RELIEVE HIM.

A. BETTER SOLUTION WOULD BE RESIGNATION BY DIEM, IF METHOD
1A ABOVE IS FOLLOWED, DIEM COULD BOW OUT SOMEWHAT GRACEFULLY
"TN ORDER TO HEAL THE WOUNDS" CAUSED BY RECENT EVENTS. WE
COULD POSSIBLY DRAFT A STATEMENT FOR HIM,

B. DISTASTEFUL AS.IT WOULD BE TO USE BAO DAL IF DIEM WILL
NOT RESIGN, I SEE NO OTHER LEGAL METHOD OF REPLACING HIM.

C. FOR TIMING AS TO NOTIFICATION OF DIEM, SEEâ€™ PARAGRAPH
3F BELOW .

3. CHOOSE SUCCESSOR TO DIEM AS PRESIDENT OF COUNCIL.

A. I BELIEVE IT IS MOST IMPORTANT TO PLACE ON FRENCH THE
ONUS AND RESPONSIBILITY OF DESIGNATING DIEM'S SUCCESSOR.
FRENCH ARE ALL TO READY TO PLACE ONUS DIEM'S LACK OF SUCCESS
ON U.S. IT WOULD BE PREFERABLE THEREFORE FOR THE HEAD OF
NEW GOVERNMENT TO BE PROPOSED BY FRENCH AND CONCURRED IN
BY THE U.S. ELY INDICATED THAT HE WOULD FAVOR QUAT, DO OR
PERHAPS EVEN EX-DEFENSE MINISTER MINH. HE STIPULATED AS
PRIMARY REQUISITE THAT ANY NEW GOVERNMENT MUST AVOID TAINT
OF COLONIALISM. HENCE I BELIEVE THAT IF ELY'S ADVICE WERS
