nen pA 1954

SENT DEPARTMENT 2250, REPEATED INFORMATION PARTS 706, PHNOM PENH,
VIENTIANE UNNUMBERED

1-C (gradusl withdrawel form Vietnam) is leest desirable, in
211 tonesty and in view of wnat I have observed here to date

it is possible this may be only sound solution. Should this

be necessary, it may be wise to concentrate effort on saving
Lsce-Cambodia-Thailand-Burme-India- line -- if possible with
latter's active support. Realize Department has protabdly given
consideration to somes such alternative. I will not presume to
advise steps to be taken eat this time, other than suggest that
we attemot persuade India recognize Governments Lsos and
Cambodia soonest.

7. Summation: (a) At present I am highly dubious of Dien's
ability to succeed but prefer to reserve final judgment till .
early \part of January; (do) alternatives to support of Diem should -
be thoroughly explored witnin US Government.

8. Recommendations: (a) US continue to support Diem at Paris;
(b) not consider alternatives paragraph 1-B with French until
after I have communicated my final judgment to Department.
