a) Will the Vietnamese National Arny as a group stick with
Diem?

b) Will the Binh Xuyen be broken up into isolated remnants?

ec) Will enough nationalist groups including sect leaders rally
to the government even against Bao Dai?

d) Will Bao Dai fire Diem, even if the answers to the above
three questions are clearly enough in the affirmative.

What I an afraid of is that the combination of continuing forces coalesced
around Diem on the one hand and Bao Dai on the other may not enjoy
preponderant strength.

7. ‘There are possibly serious enti-French overtones in the Vietnamese
political situation. These also include anti-Bao Dai feelings. We must
not take any action which would tar us with the same accusations. General.
O'Daniel, our three Attaches, and Lansdale informed us on April 30th
that "any change in leadership or command at this time could result in
chaos",

8. There are some personal aspects’ that I would like to take up
with you privately.
