SUGGESTIONS SHOULD BE PRECISE AND ENERGETIC. THERE WAS NO TIME
LEFT TOO ALLOW FOR ANYTHING LESS. MENDES WISHED REAFFIRM HIS
PAST AGREEMENT WITH SECRETARY*S THESIS THAT WE HUST DO OUR
MAXIMUM TO PERMIT DIEM GOVERNMENT TO SUCCEED. NOW HE WISHED,

ADD THAT HE WAS NO LONGER SURE THAT EVEN MAXIMUM WOULD HELP.

VARYING FKOM OUR STATED PURPOSE OF SUPPORTING DIEM GOVERNMENT AS

“LONG AS IT EXISTS WE MUST NOW PREPARE IN OUR MINDS FOR ALTERNATIVE.
