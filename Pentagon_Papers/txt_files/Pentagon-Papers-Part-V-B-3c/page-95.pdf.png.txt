7. I also attach for your perusal copies of the opening and con-
cluding addresses of Secretary Dulles at the Conference (Tabs C and D).

Implementation of the Treaty eT aad

It can be expected that several of the participating States will
shortly urge that an interim Council meet pending the time the Treaty is
ratified and goes into effect. There is a general desire to keep up the
momentum established at Manila. In such an event the subject of consul-
tations with regard to military planning as referred to in Article V will
undoubtedly arise. This is a subject to which we are giving additional
thought with a view to developing further details of a U.S. position.

Conclusion

I believe the Manila Conference accomplished the objective expected
of it from the Unites States point of view. In my judgment our Defense
representation in the U.S. Delegation succeeded in its efforts to insure
that the Treaty is consistent in its military implications with the posi-
tions taken by the Joint Chiefs of Staff and by this Department.

I should like to pay tribute to the brilliant work of Secretary
Dulles, Herman Phleger, and Douglas MacArthur II. These men carried the
principal burdens of the negotiations with forcefulness and intelligence,
and advanced the interests of the United States by their efforts.
