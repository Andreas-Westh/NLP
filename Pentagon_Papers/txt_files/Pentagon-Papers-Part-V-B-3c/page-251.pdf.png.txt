FOR SECRETARY FROM COLLINS.
DEPARTMENT TELEGRAMS 4411 ana 410. is

6. IT WOULD BE PREFERABLE TO MAKE CHANGE AFTER BANDUNG IN
ORDER AVOID GIVING VIET MINH PROPAGANDA ADVANTAGE FOR
EXPLOITATION AT CONFERENCE, HOWEVER, SINCE DIEM IS STILL
THREATENING TO TAKE INDEPENDENT ACTION TO REMOVE SANG AFTER
EASTER WEEKEND, OVER STRONG FRENCH OBJECTIONS, IT MAY BE
DESIRABLE EFFECT CHANGE AS SOON AS U.S. AND FRENCH HAVE
REACHED AGREEMENT ON CASE TO BE PRESENTED TO BAO DAT.

WHILE I RECOGNIZE DIFFICULTIES THIS CRISIS CREATES FOR U.S.
IN VIEW OF OUR WELL-KNOWN ASSOCIATION WITH DIEM, I FEAR
CONTINUED DELAY WILL LEAD TO EVEN GRAVER PROBLEMS OF
DETERIORATING FRENCH-U.S. COOPERATION IN VIET NAM,
INTENSIFICATION OF CIVIL DISORDERS CULMINATING, POSSIBLY,
IN CIVIL WAR, AND NOT IMPROBABLE ULTIMATE LOSS OF ALL VIET-
NAM TO VIET MINH, THIS EVENTUALITY WOULD BE DAMAGING NOT
ONLY TO U.S. PRESTIGE BUT, MORE IMPORTANTLY I AM CONVINCED,
TO U.S. SECURITY. MECHANICS OF POSSIBLE CHANGE OF GOVERNMENT
ARE DISCUSSED IN PART IT ABOVE.

7. OUR AGREEMENT TO REPLACEMENT OF DIEM ADMITTEDLY WILL
BE DIFFICULT TO EXPLAIN TO AMERICAN AND WORLD PRESS. I WOULD
SUGGEST SOMETHING ALONG FOLLOWING LINES:

A. DIEM HAD MADE A GREAT CONTRIBUTION TO HIS COUNTRY AT A
TIME WHEN HIS PARTICULAR QUALITIES WERE MOST VALUABLE. HE
MAINTAINED CALM AFTER GENEVA, CONTRIBUTED TO EXODUS OF
REFUGEES FROM NORTH WITH ITS GREAT PSYCHOLOGICAL IMPACT,
SUCCESSFULLY MUSTERED WORLD OPINION IN SUPPORT OF AID TO
THESE REFUGEES AND WITH SUPPORT OF FRANCE AND U.S. DEVELOPED
SOUND AND PROGRESSIVE SOCIAL, POLITICAL, ECONOMIC AND MILITARY
