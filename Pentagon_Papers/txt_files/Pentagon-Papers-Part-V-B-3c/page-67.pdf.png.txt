10. It is the judgment of the Joint Chiefs of Staff that a
Southeast Asia defense treaty should incorporate provisions
responsive to the following considerations Hayate military
aspects. :

a. The clear purpose of the treaty should be to form a
collective security arrangement to deter and, if possible,
prevent any further extension of Communist control, by
whatever means, within the general area of Southeast Asia
and the Southwest Pacific.

b. The initial membership should be limited to those
nations willing to join in the type of organization which
can be effective in accomplishing the purpose set forth

in @ above.

c. The treaty should provide for the future accession
of other powers having interests in the Far East which may
subsequently desire to join. (It is considered that the
pact should ultimately include Japan, Korea, and possibly
Nationalist China.)

d. There should be no built-in power of veto. The treaty
provisions should permit concerted action by a lesser number
than the total of the signatory nations in the event that
the political or territorial integrity of any signatory is
threatened by Communist aggression in any form.

e. Careful consideration should be given to the
practicability and desirability of providing voting
machinery in the governing council which would preclude
the possibility that, at some time in the future when
the membership is expanded, a bloc of "neutrals" or a
British Commonwealth bloc could exercise a controlling
voice.

f. The treaty should establish the moral justification
and provide the political framework and necessary machinery
within which and by which any act of overt Communist
aggression could be met by prompt military counteraction,
not excluding military action against the real source of
the aggression.
