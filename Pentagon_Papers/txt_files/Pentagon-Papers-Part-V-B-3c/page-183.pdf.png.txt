3. The task .of the United States in coping with this
situation is further complicated by:

, ae The vulnerability of the non-Communist countries
in the area militarily, and in varying degrees, politi-
cally, edanouine ally, and pSyeRonoe ne to further
“Communist expa ansionist efforts.

b. The deep-seated national antagonisms and differ-
ing assessments of national interest which divide these
countries from each other and severely harper efforts to
conbine their collective resources for their own Garonee
and welfare. ,

c.. Ihe intense nationalistic feelings, fed by re-
sidual resentments against European colonialism coupled
with a widespread feeling of weakness and inadequacy in
the face of the worldwide power struggle, which inhibit
many of these countries from cooperating closely with .
the United States, .

a. The divergencies on Far Eastern policy with our
mmcaean allies, principally with respect to our posture:
toward China, which limit the extent of political and:
economic pressures which can be maintained against the
Asian Communist regimes without divisive effects on the
basic United States-led coalition. .
