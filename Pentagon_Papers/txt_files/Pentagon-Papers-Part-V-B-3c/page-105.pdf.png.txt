accordingly consider that this is not a propitious time to

of the bilateral agreement between the United States and Cambodia
provide that all French advisors ultimately be withdrawn in
order that the United States may deal directly with the Govern-

no commitment be made at this time as to the size or composition
of armed forces to be trained and supported, nor to the size
and composition of the proposed MAAG in Cambodia, until further
study can be given to these matters.

For the Joint Chiefs of Staff:
