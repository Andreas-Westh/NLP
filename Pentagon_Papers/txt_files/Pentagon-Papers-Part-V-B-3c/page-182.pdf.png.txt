STATEMENT OF POLICY
by the
NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL
on
GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS
1. The primary problem of U. S, policy in the Far
East is to cope with the serious threat to U, S&S. security
interests which has resulted from the spread of hostile
Communist power on the ponbinent of Asia over all of
Mainland China, North Korea and, more recently, over
the northern part of Viet Nan,

2. tn ats five years of power, the regime in

Communist China has established and consolidated effective .

control over the mainland and has maintained and
developed close working relations with the Soviet Union.
While there is now no reason to anticipate an early
collapse of the regime nor any means of seeing when one
might occur, inherently such regimes have elements of
rigidity and instability. whieh sometimes produce crises,
We should be ready to exploit any opportunities which

might occur as a result of inherent internal weaknesses,
