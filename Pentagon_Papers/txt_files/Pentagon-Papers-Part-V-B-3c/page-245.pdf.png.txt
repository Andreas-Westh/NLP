C. SOME QUID PRO QUO WILL PROBABLY HAVE TO BE OFFERED

SECT LEADERS, PARTICULARLY BAY VIEN, IF LATTER IS TO AGREE
"WILLINGLY" TO SURRENDER POLICE POWERS. I UNDERSTAND THAT
IN THE PAST BAY VIEN HAS INDICATED THAT HE WOULD LIKE TO BE
MINISTER OF INTERIOR OR HAVE ONE OF HIS HENCHMEN IN THIS
POSITION, SUCH AN APPOINIMENT WOULD BE FATAL AND IT“MUST
BE MADE CLEAR TO NEW PRESIDENT THAT UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES
WOULD WE AGREE TO THIS. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT RINH XUYEN WOULD
SETTLE FOR SOME ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE FROM THE GOVERNMENT IN
THETR COMMERCIAL VENTURES. BAY VIEN AND PERHAPS GENERAL

MISSION IF THEY WERE PERMITTED TO TAKE OUT BULK OF FORTUNES
THEY HAVE ACQUIRED.
