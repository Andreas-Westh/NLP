-3- 4746, APRIL 30, 8 PM, FROM PARIS (SECTION 2 OF 2)

DIDN'T LIKE HIM. NOW THINGS HAD GONE TOO FAR AND CONSIDERATION
HAD TO BE TAKEN OF WHAT WAS BEST FOR VIETNAMESE PEOPLE AND NOT
WHAT WAS BEST FOR DIEM AND HIS FAMILY. VIETNAM WAS SUPPOSEDLY

AN INDEPENDENT COUNTRY: SHE MUST THEREFORE MAKE HER OWN DECISIONS.
BAO DAI WAS CHIEF OF STATE, AND INTENDED TO CARRY OUT HIS RESPONSI-
BILITIES AS SUCH,

16. WE ASKED WHAT BROTHER LUYEN WAS STILL DOING IN CANNES AND
WHETHER HE WAS SERVING AS INTERMEDIARY BETWEEN BAO DAT AND DIEM.
AT THIS POINT BAO DAL REALLY EXPLODED AND STATED THAT BROTHER
LUYEN HAD COME TO CANNES NOT FOR ANY PATRIOTIC PURPOSE AS

"DIEM UNDOUBTEDLY HAD TOLD AMERICANS IN SAIGON," BUT RATHER ON
SECRET MISSION FROM DIEM TO ATTEMPT TO BUY BAO DAT. SOME DAYS
AGO BEFORE ANY ACTION HAD BEEN TAKEN TO SUMMON DIEM TO FRANCE
OR OTHERWISE BAO DAI SAID LUYEN ARRIVED UNINVITED IN CANNES,

BAO DAT KEPT HIM WAITING AND WHEN HE FINALLY RECEIVED HIM,
LUYEN OFFERED BAO DAT THE SUM OF THREE HUNDRED MILLION FRANCS
IF HE WOULD AGREE NOT TO TAKE ANY ACTION WHICH WOULD AFFECT
STATUS OF DIEM OR PREVENT HIM FROM ESTABLISHING HIS AUTHORITY
BY FORCE. BAO DAI COMMENTED WITH INDIGNATION THAT, OF COURSE
HE HAD REFUSED AND "THROWN LUYEN OUT OF THE HOUSE" BUT HE WAS
STILL "GROVELLING" AROUND. HE STATED THAT LUYEN HAD MADE VARTOUS
ALLEGATIONS OF HIS CLOSE RELATIONS WITH "AMERICANS" IN SAIGON.

17. AT END OF INTERVIEW BAO DAL ASKED IF WE COULD GIVE HIM ANY
FURTHER WORD ON WASHINGTON'S REACTION TO PLAN SUBMITTED WEEK

AGO. WE EXPLAINED ONCE MORE THAT GENERAL COLLINS WAS LEAVING
WASHINGTON THAT DAY FOR SAIGON WHICH WAS SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE

OF WASHINGTON'S RECOGNITION OF EMERGENCY NATURE OF SITUATION THERE
TT WAS OBVIOUS THAT NO DECISIONS WOULD NOW BE REACHED UNTIL
GENERAL COLLINS HAD ARRIVED IN SAIGON AND COULD CONFER THERE WITH
EMBASSY AND ELY, IN MEANWHILE WE INFORMED BAO DAT THAT HIS OBSER-
VATIONS WOULD BE PASSED TO DEPT IN THEIR ENTIRETY,

18. BAO DAL SAID HE WOULD SEND DE BACK TO PARIS MONDAY IN ORDER
TO REMAIN IN TOUCH WITH US AND TO RECEIVE ANY OBSERVATIONS WASH-
INGTON CARED TO MAKE TO HIM. AT SAME TIME HE WOULD INSTRUCT

DE TO KEEP US AU COURANTE,

DILLON
