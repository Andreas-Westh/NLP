-2- SECTO 8, MAY 8, 5 EM (SECTION THREE OF THREE), FROM PARIS

SECRETARY REPLIED THAT HE APPRECIATED FRANKNESS, IT IS

ONLY WAY FRIENDS SHOULD SPEAK TO EACH OTHER, -THERE IS A .-
FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FRANCE AND US. US HAS HIGHER
REGARD OF DIEM'S CAPABILITIES THAN FRANCE. US INFORMED

"COUP DE FORCE" WAS ENGINEERED BY BINH XUYEN WHILE FRENCH SAY
OTHERWISE. SECRETARY HIMSELF HAD HAD DOUBTS THAT DIEM COULD
SURVIVE. IT WAS QUESTIONABLE WHETHER ARMY WAS LOYAL TO HIM

AND HE DID NOT CONTROL THE NATIONAL POLICE, LOYALTY OF FRENCH
GOVT ITSELF IN SUPPORT OF DIEM WAS NOT QUESTIONED BUT THERE WERE
DIFFICULTIES FROM OTHER SOURCES SUCH AS RADIO FRANCAISE-ASIE,

US DOES NOT AGREE WITH FRENCH OPINION OF DIEM, IF He HAD BEEN
A NON-ENTITY HE WOULD HAVE COLLAPSED BUT HE DID NOT. HF SHOWED
SO MUCH ABILITY THAT US FATLS TO SEE HOW HE CAN BE GOT KID OF
NOW. IT IS ASSUMED THAT FRANCE WOULD NOT WISH TO DO SO BY FORCE.

DIEM IS STRONGER NOW THAN WHEN BAO DAT FIRST WITHDREW HIS
POWERS. WORST ASPECT IS THAT PROBLEM INVOLVES DIFFERENCE OF
OPINION BETWEEN FRANCE AND US. VIETNAM IS NOT WORTH QUARREL
WITH FRANCE, COMMON INTERESTS ARE TOO GREAT TO BE JEOPARDIZED
BY DIFFERENCE OF OPINION ON VIETNAM, SEGRETARY AGREED WITH
FRENCH STATEMENT THAT IT MUST NOT AFFECT FRANCO-US RELATIONS IN
OTHER AREAS, IF IT WOULD SOLVE PROBLEM, US WOULD WITHDRAW AND
DROP ITS SUPPORT OF VIETNAM. FRANCO-US DIFFERENCES MUST BE
RESOLVED NOW FOR SECRETARY DID NOT BELIEVE THAT US CONGRESS
WOULD CONTINUE WITH ITS PRESENT ATD PROGRAM OTHERWISE. SUB-
STANTIAL SUMS OF 4 TO 5 HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ARE INVOLVED.

CHOICE OPEN TO US IS TO HAVE DIEM SUPPORTED OR TO WITHDRAW.

IT IS GRAVE PROBLEM WHICH THE SECRETARY WOULD LIKE TO THINK

ABOUT OVERNIGHT, FRENCH SUGGESTIONS ARE SERIOUS AND MUST BE
WEIGHED CAREFULLY. ADVICE AND COUNSEL ARE NEEDED. US INTEREST IN
VIETNAM IS SIMPLY TO WITHHOLD AREA FROM COMMUNISTS. US WILL GIVE
CONSIDERATION TO ANY SUGGESTION FRENCH MAKE BUT MUST WARN THAT US
FINANCIAL SUPPORT MAY NOT BE EXPECTED TO ANY SOLUTION WHICH SEC-
RETARY CAN THINK OF AS ALTERNATIVE TO DIEM. QUESTION MUST BE
TAKEN UP AGAIN TOMORROW,

MACMILLAN STATED THAT BRITISH INTERESTS IN VIETNAM WERE MORE IN-
DIRECT BUT NONETHELESS VITAL BECAUSE (1) INTEREST IN AREA ITSELF
AND (2) INTEREST IN COMMUNIST THREAT FROM ANY AREA IN WORLD. IT
WOULD BE GRAVE ERROR TO REACH DECISION THAT EVENING. FOREIGN MIN-
ISTERS ARE TO BE IN PARIS SEVERAL DAYS AND SHOULD LOOK INTO MATTER
AGAIN, EVENTS MIGHT OVERTAKE OUR DECISIONS. ACCURATE REVIEW OF
