reorganize the dispersed forces of Vietnam, it may be several
years before an effective military force will exist. There-
fore, U.S. military support to that area, including the train-
ing and equipping of forces, should be accomplished at low
priority and not at the expense of other U.S. military programs
and should rot be permitted to impair the development through
MDA programs of effective and reliable allied forces elsewhere.

ii. In addition, the Joint Chiefs of Staff note with con-
eern the unstable political situation presently existing within
the state of South Viet Nam, and, accordingly, consider that
this is not a propitious time to further indicate United States
intentions with respect to the support and training of Vietnamese

forces.
