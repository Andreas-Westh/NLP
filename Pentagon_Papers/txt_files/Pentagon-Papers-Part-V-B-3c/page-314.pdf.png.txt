E. Quite regardless of future developments, episodes of last week, featured
by increasing strain in French-Vietnemese relations, cannot help but severely
jeopardize France's long range interests in Vietnam. Of late one hears less
and less mention of maintenance cultural and economic interests and

influence and more and more of threats that France will drop responsibilities
ane withdraw FEC.‘ We believe this to be passing phase, however.

F. Reference the activities of evotutl anes Committee and States General
local French have same fears that we do. French are convinced that Revolu-
tionary Committee is penetrated by Viet’Minh agents, but have so far been

v 2zble to give us eny conclusive proof. They are also skeptical about the
States General being able to modify radical resolutions of the Revolutionary
Committee. : =

G I think it is fair to say that French are convinced that Diem desires
oyerthrow Bao Dai and will continue efforts to do so irrespective of current
activities of Revolutionary Committee.

H. As indicated in recent telegrams, General Fly end the Commissariat General
in Saigon have become so emotional in their bitter opposition to Diem and

his entourage, that I fear they have lost some of their objectivity as to
popular reaction to Dien's recent moves, his hold on the Army, and his ability
to deal with the Binh Xuyen. They are quite convinced that serious warfare
Will be initiated by the Binh Xuyen, and that anti-French sentiment fomented
by Diem and perhaps Viet Minh may still cause serious outbréaks in foreign
sections of Saigon.
