-2- 448, APRIL 9, 1OP.M. (SECTION FIVE OF FIVE), FROM SATGON
REFORMS FOR HIS COUNTRY.

B. PERHAPS IT WAS INEVITABLE THAT IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE
PROGRAMS WOULD DEVELOP DEVISIVE INFLUENCES AMONG THE PEOPLE
OF VIETNAM, WHO HAVE ONLY RECENTLY GAINED THEIR INDEPENDENCE.
THEY HAVE HAD LITTLE EXPERIENCE IN MEETING THE COMPLEX PROBLEMS
WHICH THEY FACE, SUCH AS RECONCILING DIFFERENT INTERESTS OF
SECTS AND VARIOUS REGIONS OF THE COUNTRY. THIS HAS RESULTED
IN CLASHES OF PERSONALITY, WHICH HAD MUCH TO DO WITH THE
CURRENT CRISIS, INVOLVING THE "UNIFIED FRONT‚Äù ORGANIZATION.
RESULTANT BLOODSHED, EVEN THOUGH NOT EXTENSIVE, HAS CREATED
DEEP WOUNDS WHICH WILL BE DIFFICULT FOR PRESENT GOVERNMENT
TO HEAL.

C. DIEM WAS UNABLE OR UNWILLING TO TAKE INTO HIS GOVERNMENT
MEMBERS OF VARIOUS OPPOSITION PARTIES, ONLY WITH BROAD
SUPPORT CAN THE PROGRESSIVE PROGRAMS DEVELOPED BY DIEM BE
MADE EFFECTIVE. THE NEW GOVERNMENT IS HEADED BY A MAN WHO
HAS HAD EXPERIENCE IN GOVERNMENT AND WHOSE PERSONALITY IS
SUCH THAT HE SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET OTHER STRONG MEN TO WORK
WITH HIM. HE HAS ADOPTED THE SAME BASIC PROGRAMS WHICH
DIEM INITIATED AND WHICH HAVE, THE FULL SUPPORT OF BOTH

U.S. AND FRANCE, DECISION AS TO WHO SHOULD HEAD GOVERNMENT
OF VIETNAM IS, OF COURSE, ONE TO BE MADE BY THE VIETNAMESE
PEOPLE UNDER THEIR OWN SYSTEM. WHILE CHANGE IN PRESIDENCY
INVOLVES TEMPORARY LOSS TO VIETNAM OF A GREAT NATIONALIST
LEADER, IT DOES NOT IN ANY SENSE MEAN A CHANGE IN THE POLICIES
OF HIS GOVERNMENT WHICH HAVE DRAWN U.S. SUPPORT. WITH THIS
SUPPORT AND THE COOPERATION OF ALL ELEMENTS OF VIETNAM,

THE COUNTRY CAN BE SAVED FROM COMMUNISM.
