FOR SECRETARY FROM COLLINS.

DEPARTMENT TELEGRAMS 4411 and 4412, .

6. FORM NEW CABINET. DURING THIE PERIOD, THE NEW PRESIDENT
WILL HAVE BREN CONSULTING WITH POSSIBLE NEW CABINET MEMBERS.
AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE, HE SHOULD FORM HIS NEW GOVERNMENT
AND ANNOUNCE IT.

7. REORGANIZE GOVERNMENT STRUCTURE.

A. OUR TENTATIVE THINKING ON THIS POINT HAS BEEN COVERED
IN SOME DETATL IN RECENT TELEGRAMS,

B. WE FEEL IT WOULD BE ADVISABLE UNDER CURRENT CONDITIONS
FOR PRESIDENT, AFTER CONSULTATION WITH HIS CABINET AND
SEPARATELY WITH ELY AND ME, TO APPOINT A "HIGH COUBICIL",.
CONSISTING OF REPRESENTATIVES OF VARIOUS INTELLECTUAL GROUPS,
LABOR, SECTS AND OTHER RELIGIOUS GROUPS, REFUGEES, AND
DISTINGUISHED PERSONALTIES SUCH AS FORMER PRESIDENT LONG,

MY PERSONAL JUDGMENT IS THAT THIS COUNCIL SHOULD NOT INCLUDE.
PEOPLE LIKE GENERAL HINH, BUT HOT, TAN OR HUU, THOUGH FRENCH
MIGHT INSIST UPON INCLUSION OF SOME SUCH PEOPLE.

C. DIEM HAS INDICATED THAT HE WOULD FAVOR APPOINEMENT OF

AN ECONOMIC ADVISORY COUNCIL, INCLUDING SOME FOREIGN EXPERTS.
CERTAINLY TECHNICALLY COMPETENT PEOPLE WILL BE NEEDED IN
ECONOMIC FIELD, THOUGH THEY COULD BE SUPPLIED TO GOVERNMENT
THROUGH FRENCH AND AMERICAN ECONOMIC AID PROGRAMS. HOWEVER,

IT MIGHT BE WELL TO HAVE THEM CARRIED OFFICIALLY TW AN ADVISORY
COUNCIL.

D. BASED ON OUR EXPERIENCE HERE, I FEEL THAT THERE SHOULD

PERMANENT BE A VICE
