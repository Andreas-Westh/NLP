-2- 663, APRIL 19, 11 P.M., FROM SAIGON (SET TWO OF TWO).

DIEM REPLIED THAT NEITHER DID HE WISH CIVIL WAR, BUT ADDED
THAT "FEUDALISTS" ARE UNSCRUPULOUS. I SAID THAT I MUST REPORT
TO MY GOVERNMENT THAT I BELIEVED DIEM"S COURSE OF ACTION

MUST LEAD TO CIVIL WAR. ,

6. I TOLD DIEM THAT ALL VIETNAMESE WITH WHOM I HAD TALKED
WERE LIKEWISE OPPOSED TO COLONIALISM, FEUDALISM AND COMMUNISH.
HOWEVER, THEY DIFFER AS TO METHODS OF TACKLING THESE PROBLEMS
AND DO NOT APPROVE OF DIEM"S WAY OF WORKING, DIEM SATD THAT
ON THE CONTRARY THEY DID NOT OPPOSE HIS METHODS, BUT HIS
POLITICAL CONCEPTS, HE ADDED THAT EVERY TIME A COMPROMISE

IS MADE THE PROBLEM RETURNS IN MORE ACUTE FORM. THE PEOPLE
DO NOT LIKE THIS.

7. I ASKED WHAT DIEM WOULD DO IF BAO DAT DECIDED TO MAKE

A CHANGE OF PRIME MINISTER, DIEM SAID BAO DAT HAS POWER

TO DO SO AND WILL DECIDE, HOWEVER, EXPERIENCE IN VIETNAM
DURING THE WAR HAD PROVED COMPROMISE TO BE INEFFECTUAL.

IT WILL BE UNFORTUNATE IF BAO DAL DOES NOT ACCEPT HIS COURSE

OF ACTION, I TOLD DIEM THAT I BELIEVED THAT IF NO COALITION
WERE EFFECTED PRIOR TO ELECTIONS, BAO DAT WOULD MAKE A

CHANGE, I HAD TRIED TO ASSIST VIETNAMESE TO AVOID DRASTIC
SOLUTION OF THIS SORT, BUT UNLESS GOVERNMENT IS EFFECTIVELY
BROADENED, I BELIEVE THERE WILL BE A CHANGE. DIEM SAID HE

WAS CONTINUING HIS POLITICAL CONVERSATIONS TO TEST ACCEPTABILITY
OF HIS IDEAS. I SAID I HOPED HE WOULD DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE
TO AVOID OPEN CONFLICT DURING BY ABSENCE, DIEM SAID THAT IF HE
HAD REMOVED SANG AS CHIEF OF POLICE IN BEGINNING, HE WOULD NOW
HAVE SAIGON WELL IN HAND.

8. I ASKED IF HE HAD HAD ANY REPORTS FROM LUYEN. DIEM REPLIED
THAT BAO DAL WAS ABSENT WHEN LUYEN ARRIVED. HE SAID THAT LUYEN
HAD REPORTED THAT PEOPLE IN PARIS HAD NO UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT
WAS GOING ON IN VIETNAM,

9, ON TAKING MY DEPARTURE I SAID THAT IN MY OPINION BAO DAT
WOULD REMOVE DIEM IF HE CONTINUED AS AT PRESENT. I HAD DONE
MY BEST TO HELP. I ADMIRED HIS ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND HIS
CHARACTER, BUT NOT HIS METHOD OF WORKING AND ONLY REGRETTED
THAT I HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO DO MORE FOR HIM AND HIS COUNTRY.
