METHOD OF FINANCING COMBAT OPERATIONS

15. Whether or not the U.S. intervenes in Indochina, the Joint
Chiefs of Staff consider that it is vital that the war in Indo-
china be financed by a method separate and distinct from the
world-wide MDAP, It is imperative that the commander be pro-
vided with the necessary equipment to wage war effectively
without the financial and legal restrictions imposed by MDAP
procedures. The current practice of diverting MDA funds from
approved programs to support emergency requirements such as
those resulting from combat operations in Indochina has al-
ready had the effect of hindering the attainment of our world-
wide strategic objectives. Only by divorcing the fluid require-
ments which exist in local combat situations from the normal
MDA programming methods and procedures can the orderly achieve-
ment of our objectives in other world areas be achieved.
