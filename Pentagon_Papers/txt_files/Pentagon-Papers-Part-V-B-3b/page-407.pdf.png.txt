It is probable that initial Soviet tactics were to
forestall US intervention in the Delta by some kind of a
compromise formula involving Hanoi and Haiphong if it
appeared that such intervention were imminent. The recent
raising of the ante in the negotiations here by the
Communist side probably reflects an estimate on their part
that our intervention is improbable and that they are safe
to go ahead there, keeping, of course, a sharp eye out for
indications of change in our attitude.

While the Communist position on Laos and Cambodia
remains more flexible than their position in regard to
the Delta, they will get all they can in Laos now. In the
whole are the determing factor for the Communists
will continue to be their estimate of the likelihood of
US or joint intervention and nothing short of a conviction
on their part that this intervention will take place will
stop them from going ahead with their plans for taking all
of it eventually, through military conquest, French
capitulation, or infiltration.

Realize much of above is repetitious, but it will
serve as final summary.
