in North Africa, in Europe, and as a world power.

b, The free world stake in Indochina.

Cc. The impact of the loss of Indochina upon the

over-all strategy of France's free world partners,

26. Reiterate to the French:

Be That in the absence of a marked improvement
in the military situation there is no basis for
negotiation with any prospect for acceptable terms.

regime would eventually turn the country over to
Ho Chi Minh with no oppoz â€œtunity for the replacement of
the French by the United States or the United Kingdon,
27. Flatly oppose any idea of a cease-fire as a
preliminary to negotiati ONS , because sucn a cease-fire would
result in an irretrievable deterioration of the Franco-

Vietnamese military position in Indochina.

consult the Vietnamese and obtain their approval of all

actions related to any response to Viet Minh offers to
negotiate, |

29. if the French actually enter into negotiations
with the communists, insist that the United States be con~-

A

sulted and seek to influence the course of the negotiations.
