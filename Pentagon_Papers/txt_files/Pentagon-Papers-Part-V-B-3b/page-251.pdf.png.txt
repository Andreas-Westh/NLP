5. The Joint Chiefs of Steft share the View of the US DBL

t once armistice oroposais are made the French would rapidly
move toward acceptance of the probable Communist counterproposal
of an innmediate cease-fire. Snould-the United States associate
‘itself with the Prench duttial proposal, the United States would
in all likelihood be confronted subsequently with the painful

alternatives of continuing to support the French through retro-

gressive positions or of extricating itself at some point along

the way.

6. The Joint Chiefs of Staff asree that it is no longer
realistic to insist thet the French continue aggressively £0
prosecute the Navarre Plan. At the same time, they adhere to
their view that no satisfactory settlement is possible without
e- substantial improvement in the French Union military situa~
tion, and het, in the absence Bhs settlement which would
reasonably assure the political and territorial integrity of
the Associated States, any armistice entered into would
inevitably lead to the eventual loss of that area to Communist

control. i? 2
