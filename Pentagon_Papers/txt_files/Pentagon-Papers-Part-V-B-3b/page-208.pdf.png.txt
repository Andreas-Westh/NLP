PARIS AND LONDON EYES ONLY AMBASSADOR

I met for about an hour this afternoon with Eden and Bidault
at latter's villa. Meeting was called at latter's request
with no (repeat no) indication its purpose.

After some discussion procedural problems Indochina conference

(reported separately) discussion turnsd to Bao Dai's declara-
tion in Paris and current attitude. Bidault told us that he
understands Bao Dai named as his personal representative and
has not (repeat not) been able to confirm observer's arrival e«
his station in Evian. .

Bidault then launched into rather confusec discussion of prob
lem his government faces with regard to establishing position
for Indochina negotiation which he said was extremely diffi-
cult ‘during progress of Dien Bien Phu battle. He touched
lightly on-< =whole range of possibilities including cotpechive
defense, cease-fire and partvitior He mentioned further de-
terioration in political sitvation in Associated States.

Eden picked up the question of cease-fire and encouraged fur
ther discussion by Bidault this subject with cryptic remark
that a wonth ego British had felt cease-firs dus to general
infiltration was dangerous but that now without having any

‘clear view they were not (repeat not) so sure. I pointed out

that cease-fire at Dien Bien Phu locally would be in fact
surrender and that cease- tire gener rally would involve serious
ine with resultant massacreésof
