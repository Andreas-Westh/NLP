said that the French~on“timing” of election are holding out

for 18 months after completion of regrouping which, he said,
would wean 22 or 24 months after cease-fire. Viet Minh are
asking for elections six months after cease-fire. Mendes

other day in Saigon wher né was quoted as having said that _

that" this is too soon and not in the interests of Vietnam,

and it runs counter to what the French were trying to obtain
at Geneva. 3
