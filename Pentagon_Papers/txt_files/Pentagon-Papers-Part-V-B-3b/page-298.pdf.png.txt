6. The Joint Chiefs of Staff recommend that U.S. participa-
tion be limited primarily to Naval and Alr Forces, The com-
position of these forces should be on the order of the following:

@. Naval Forces. A fast carrier Task Force and supporting

forces as necessary in accordance with developments in the
situation.

b. Air Fovees. U.S. Alr Force units operating from present
bases outside Indochina as may be required. The order of
magnitude of this effort cannot now be estimated since it
will depend on developments in the situation,

7. The Joint Chiefs of Staff note that the principal sources
of Viet Minh military supply Jie outside Indochina, The destruc-
tion or neutralization of those outside sources supporting the
Viet Minh would materially reduce the French military problems
in Indochina, ,

&. The Joint Chiefs of Staff believe that comultting to the
Indochina conflict Naval forces in-.excess of the above or basing
Bubstantial air forces therein will involve maldeployment of
. forces and reduced readiness to meet probable Chinese Comnunist
reaction elsewhere in the Far East. From the point of view of
the United States, with reference to the Far East as a whole,
Indochina is devoid of decisive military objectives and the
allocation of more than token U.S. armed forces to that area
would be a serious diversion of limited U.S. capabilitics.,

For the Joint Chiefs of Staff:

ARTHUR RADFORD,
Chairnen,
Joint Chiefs of Staff.
