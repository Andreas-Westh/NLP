position than it is already: |
| a. France and Vietnam should sign draft treaties promptly.
b. At moment of signature, President of Republic, in his capacity as >
President of French Union, should make statement to effect that Union is

“composed of equal and sovereign states.

ce, A declaration that French will withdraw their expeditionary force from

consistent with France's obligations to Associated States, unless invited by

respective governments of Associated States to maintain their forces. (Comment :

opinion they ane in earnest, We feel such declaration should be made at actual
time of signing or at least immediately after. Would appreciate your views as
how and by whom this could be most effectively made.) This provision would not

(repeat not) prejudice any base agreements which might be reached with Associated

States. If United States or any other forces have been committed , we and any

other countries would join in or make similar declaration,
i. Unless above are followed promptly by concrete actions which bear out

professed intentions of good faith, hopsd-fop favorable reaction will not (repsat’ not).
