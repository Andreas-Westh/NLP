(SOUTHEAST ASTA):

Subject: U.S. Objectives and Courses of Action
with Respect to Southeast Asia (NSC 5405)

Reference: .Secretary of Defense memorandum,
4 March 1954, subject as above

In accordance with the above request from the
Secretary of Defense, the following informal comments are
submitted: ;

.&. Reference paragraph 21.

(1) On 14 December 1953, the Secretary of Defense
informed the Chief, MAAG, Indochina, that Indochina
has the highest MDAP priority. It is the only nation
with this priority classification and, as such, has
precedence over every other allied nation and the
U.S. armed forces for the allocation of equipment in
short supply. Generally, military assistance equip-

.ment is being delivered at the scheduled rates, which
are up to the capability of Indochinese forces to
utilize effectively. Thailand is being furnished MDA
equipment under a limited program. This material is
generally being delivered at the rate at which the
Thailand forees can most effectively utilize it.
Burma is not a recipient nation for MDAP grant aid.
Initial arrangements have been made to provide Burma
on a reimbursable basis, but no actual deliveries
under this program have yet been made.

(2) Major General O'Daniel has been appointed Chief,
MAAG, Indochina. This was as a result of an NSC action
designed to increase the influence of the United States
in the prosecution of the war in Indochina, particularly
training of local forces, effective command and intel-
ligence arrangements, and operational planning.
