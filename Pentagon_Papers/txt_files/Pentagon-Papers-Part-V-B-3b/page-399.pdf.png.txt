RPTD INFO: Amembassy Moscow 138 EYES ONLY FOR AMBASSADOR

I saw Molotov at his villa yesterday evening at my
request to inform him of my departure, and because I felt
time had come to sound a note of warning. Talk lasted
more than hour and a half. Molotov asked what I thought
would be best thing to do with Conference, to adjourn it
temporarily or to keep it going. I replied as far as we
concerned should be kept going while there was hope of
reaching reasonable settlement, but that there was no use
referring to "committees" matters of major policy which
must be decided by the Conference as a whole. Before my
departure I felt 2% would be desirable to exchange views,
in order that mistakes of the past should not be repeated
as the result of misunderstanding of our respective positions.
With regard to Korean phase, I had only to say that in
reserving our position re final Chinese prondeet had not
implied to exclude Commnist China from future discussions
on Korean question. As matter of fact, China was belligerent
there against UN and for practical reasons would have to be

party to settlement.
