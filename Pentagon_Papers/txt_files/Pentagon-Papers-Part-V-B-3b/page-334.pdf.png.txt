hk, Jurdical r√©lations in the French Union: Giving effect to the
independence of the Associated States - Our goal here must be to have
France make it unmistakably clear to world opinion, and above all, the
Vietnamese that the Treaty of Independence between France and Vietnam
represents a full and unqualified commitment on the part of France
which will be carried out in practice. Since the peoples of the Associated
States are still mistrustful of French promises, French actions must be

underwritten by the U.S.
