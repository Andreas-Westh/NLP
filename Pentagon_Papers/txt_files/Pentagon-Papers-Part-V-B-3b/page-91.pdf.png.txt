A. That the U. S. and U. K. and France reach an agroae-
ment with respect to Indochin2 which rejects all of the
courses emunerated above (except No. 1 on the assumption
that the stutus quo can be altered to result in a military

oppose each of these solutions , Should not entertain dis-

should ensure that no Be cements are reached.
