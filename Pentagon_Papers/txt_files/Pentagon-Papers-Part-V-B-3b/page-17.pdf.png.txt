The White House views the JCS position on intervention

in Indochina as not inwolving any new policy issue

relative to HSC 5405. However, a pencilled Secretary

of Defense marginal note indicates that the White House

"misses the point” -- the JCS was considering the

"regional grouping" and others in the grouping, i.e.,

U.K. may object to NSC 5405 policy. Hence the JCS is

warning “not to get involved in such 2 grouping" unless

all parties accept direct action. White House Memo-

randum for Secretary of Defense, 26 May 1954. ....ceccceeeeeee HOW

Ely emphasizes particular points to Trapnell and Dillon:

(1) Ely was not in accord with O'Daniel's proposal to

reorgenize the Vietnamese army on a divisional basis,

(2) O'Daniel's operational war plan was unrealistic,

(3) the increasing frequency of American criticism of

French “conduct of the war was not appreciated, (4) Ely

was regrouping his forces for defense of the Delta, and

(5) one or two U.S. Marine divisions could assure ‘
defense of the Delta. Paris 4566 to Dulles, 27 May 1954..... 495

The U.S. Delegation to Geneva clearly sees a forthcoming
settlement which the U.S., under NSC, cannot associate

itself with. Both the dangers of partition and impossi-

bility of armistice supervision in Indochina are recog-

nized. "There is very little that the Defense Depart-

ment can do to influence the negotiations, since 4

political decision has been made that the U.S. will

continue to participate” even though partition will.

ultimately result in loss of Indochina to communism.

Dillon clarifies apparent misunderstanding in Washington
on French understandings of U.S. intervention if Red China
attacks Indochina. Paris 4607 to Dulles, 30 May 1954........ 503

Schuman, Ely, and Laniel inform Dillon and Trapnell that
France regards the present bilateral negotiations as a |
"prelude to U.S. intervention should Geneva fail” or
should the communists drac negotiations itv uotain a

military decision in the Delta. The French pursue’ re-
assurance of U.S. intervention if Red China launches an

all-out air attack. Paris 4612 to Dulles, 31 May 1954....... 506
