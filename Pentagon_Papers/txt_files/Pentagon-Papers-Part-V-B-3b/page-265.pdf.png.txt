â€™ SATGON EYES ONLY AMBASSADOR

Laniel asked me to come to see him at 10 Sunday night. I
found him in a strong and courageous mood reminiscent of the
conversations I had last summer at the beginning of the ne-
gotiations over the Navarre plan and quite in contrast with
his mood of the past few weeks. He stated that he plans to
take a very firm position in the National Assembly on Tuesday
when Indochina problem comes up again. He plans to say that
there are decisions of vital military importance to be taken
daily at Geneva. If the National Assembly has someone else in
mind whom they can put into office promptly to handle these
decisions in a better fashion than he can, they should do so,
but that if they are not (repeat not) prepared for the immediate
reconstitution of a new government (which they are not) they
should stop talking about Indochina and let the government get
on with its difficult task.

Laniel then expressed considerable concern regarding (1) the
prospects at Geneva; and (2) and more important, the military
situation in Indochina. He felt that Indochina phase of Geneva
conference hud got off to a bad start and considered it very
likely that in view of the division and weakness among the
Western powers, the Communists will not (repeat not) accept the
French proposal for a cease-fire with cuarantees, but will press
for what in effect would be total surrender.

He said it had been made clear to the French delegation by the
Commnists that they could not (repeat not) have any conversations
direct with the Viet Minh at Geneva but must in all cases proceed
through the Chinese. This, plus the fact of large scale Chinese
intervention at Dien-Bien-Phu, made it clear that the enemy France

is facing
