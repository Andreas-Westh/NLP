conversation with the governments of the United Kingdom, France,
and, if deemed advisable, with the governments of the Associated
States preliminary to the conference. In this connection, atten-
tion is particularly requested to paragraphs 25 and 26 of NSC
5405; it is considered to be of the utmost importance that the
French Government be urged not to abandon the aggressive prosecu-
tion of military operations until a satisfactory settlement has
been achieved.

ll. It is further recommended that, in order to be prepared
for possible contingencies which might arise incident to the
Geneva Conference, the National Security Council considers now
the extent to which the United States would be willing to commit
its resources in support of the Associated States in the effort
to prevent the loss of Indochina to the Communists either:

~a. In concert with the French; or

b. In the event the French elect to withdraw, in con-
cert with other allies or, if necessary, unilaterally.

12. In order to assure ample opportunity for the Joint Chiefs
of Staff to present their views on these matters, it is requested
that the Military Services be represented on the Department of
Defense working team which, in coordination with the Department
of State, will consider all U.S. position papers pertaining to
the Geneva discussions on Indochina.

For the Joint Chiefs of Staff:

2 ARTHUR RADFORD,
Chairman,
Joint Chiefs of Staff.
