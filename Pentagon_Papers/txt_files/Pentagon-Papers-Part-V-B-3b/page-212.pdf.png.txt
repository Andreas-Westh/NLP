¢. From the military viewpoint, insofar as relief of
Dien Bien Phu is concerned, the project is of little value.

d,. Psychological aspects might well be satisfied by
confining projects to the field at Seno only.

e. Maintaining Seno field operational would require
a continuing supply effort of considerable proportions.

f£. Local defense of field and any ground line of com-
munications would have to be increased to counter Viet Minh
guerrilla operations which would increase with the added
importance of the airfield.

4. The Joint Chiefs of Staff consider* that:

‘a. From a military viewpoint, the proposal of the French,
except for supply of naval aircraft, should be rejected.

b. If, for other than military reasons, the proposal is
approved, the U.S. commitment should be limited to rehabilita-
tion and extension of the Seno airfield.

* The Chief of Staff, U.S. Army invites attention to his addi-
tional views expressed at the 6 April 1954 meeting of the Armed
Forces Policy Council and submitted through the Joint Chiefs of
Staff to the Secretary of Defense for his information by a cover-
ing memorandum, dated 22 April 1954, subject: "Indochina." te

For the Joint Chiefs of Staff:
