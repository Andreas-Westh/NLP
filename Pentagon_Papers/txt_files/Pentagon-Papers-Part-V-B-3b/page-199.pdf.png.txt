that the US provide a large carrier and aircraft of types familiar to French
pilots for French air strikes in support of the Dien Bien Phu battle (see
attached cable) it would appear that:

a. The French will have had the "Belleau Wood" a whole year without
making use of her in the fight for Indochina.

b. She is currently being used as a delivery wagon rather than as
a combat vessel.

c. Despite France's urgent need for additional fighter aircraft
in NATO and in Indochina the French will manage to find time to build,
sell and deliver 32 jets to India.
