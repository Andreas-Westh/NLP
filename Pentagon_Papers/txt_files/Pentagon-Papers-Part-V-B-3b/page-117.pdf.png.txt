(1) a French and Associated States invitation to the United
States = participate Fe ich or (2) an Associated States
invitation to the United States after a French decision to
withdraw, and French Willingness to cooperate in phasing out
French forces as U. S. forces are phased in, If neither of
- these assumptions proved valid the fea asibility of U. S. inter-
vention would be vitiated, If the French, having decided on
withdrawal and a negotiated settlene ent, should oppose U, S&S.
intervention and should carry the Associated States with them
in such opposition, U. S. intervention in Indochina would in
effect be precluded, If, after a French decision to withdraw,
â€œthe Associated States should appeal for U, &. military assist-
ance but the French decided not to cooperate in the phasing
in of U. S. forees, a successful U. S. intervention would be

very difficult.

Pesiravility and Form cf U. S. Intervention

be lost to the Communists, and which alternative it should

select?

strain on the basic western coalition, increased risk of

war with China and of general war, high costs in U, S.
