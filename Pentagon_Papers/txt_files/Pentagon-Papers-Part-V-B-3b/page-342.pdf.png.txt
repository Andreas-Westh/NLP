SUMMARY OF ODM STUDIES RE MOBILIZATION PLANS IN THE EVENT OF U.S.

ARMED INTERVENTION IN INDOCHINA WITHOUT CHINESE INTERVENTION (SITUATION
A) OR WITH CHINESE INTERVENTION (SITUATION B)

GENERAL

The need for mobilization actions depends far more on the induced
effects of public interpretation of events than on the direct impact of
military outlays. The expectations and interpretations of the public will
lead to serious economic consequences unless offset by appropriate
government action. The increased direct effects of the military programs
would be moderate for either Situation A or B in FY 55 and FY 56. The
induced effects of either situation could have a very serious result
particularly on price level and less seriously on the supply and
distribution of materials. They would have only a slight effect on over-
all manpower availability. The measures which ODM proposes are most
comprehensive in the field of stabilization and least so in manpower.

INDUSTRIAL MOBILIZATION

1. The Defense Materials System will continue to be 4 key element
in industrial mobilization,

2. The rate of stockpile accumulation for a selected few critical
materials will be protected.

3. Inventory controls will be imposed in both Situations A and B,

4, Funds will be requested to erect plants and acquire equipment
to overcome deficiencies in the mobilization base.

5. Preparatory work for more serious military conditions will
go forward.

MANPOWER MOBTLIZATTON
1. The potential supply of military manpower available in the
selective service pool and military reserves is sufficient to meet
anticipated requirements under Situation A or B. However, certain
policies and actions would be required to meet the demands of Situation B,
Briefly they are:
a. Statutory authority for involuntary recall or reservists.

b. Statutory authority for extension of terms of service,

ec. Elimination of fatherhood as a basis for deferment.
