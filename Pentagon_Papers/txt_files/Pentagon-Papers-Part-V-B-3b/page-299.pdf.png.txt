MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE

Subject: Defense of Southeast Asia in the Event
of Loss of Indochina to the Communists

1. . As a result of recent military and political develop-
ments, including certain public statements by high-level
officials of the United States, the Joint Chiefs of Staff
eonsider that it is incumbent upon them to determine what
military forces and resources would be required to hold
Southeast Asia against further Communist aggression in the
event Indochina is lost to the Communists.

2. Currently approved United States Government objectives
regarding Southeast Asia are based on the considerations
that:

a. The passing of the countries. of Southeast Asia
into the Communist orbit would be inimical to the security
interests of the United States, and

b. The loss of Indochina to the Communist orbit could
lead to the eventual loss of the other countries of South-
â€˜east Asia to the Communist orbit.

3. In the event that Indochina is lost to the Communists,
the United States must take as an objective the prevention
of the loss of the rest of Southeast Asia (Thailand, Burma,
and Malay) to the Communists.

4, There are two basic military concepts for the defense
of Southeast Asia:
a. Static type defense (Korea type).

b. An offensive to attack the source of Communist
military power being applied in Southeast Asia.
