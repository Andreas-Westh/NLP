MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE

Subject: Suspension of U.S. Military Aid to
Indochina in Event of a Cease Fire.

1. The possibility exists that a cease fire in Indochina
may be agreed upon either at Geneva or unilaterally between
the French and the Viet Minh. In that event, the Viet Minh
would likely covertly extend their control over large areas
currently held by French Union Forces and cause major defec-
tions of these forces. This would result in a quick deteriora-
tion of the entire French Union position and enable the Viet
Minh to seize large amounts of U.S. Mutual Defense Assistance
Program (MDAP) materiel and supplies.

2. In light of the foregoing, the Joint Chiefs of Staff
consider it necessary that the United States adopt the follow-
ing position reference future MDAP assistance to Indochina:

In the event of a cease fire in Indochina, the shipment
of military end items under U.S. MDAP provided under the
â€œAgreement for Mutual Defense Assistance in Indochina
between the United States of America and Cambodia, France,
Laos, and Vietnam," will immediately be suspended, except

forfor such spares and associated maintenance items necessary
to the maintenance of equipment in operations. The entire
question of U.S. aid to Indochina will be re-examined in
the light of circumstances then existing.

3. It is the opinion of the Joint Chiefs of Staff that the
"Agreement for Mutual Defense Assistance in Indochina between
the United States of America and Cambodia, France, Laos, and
Vietnam," of 23 December 1950, provides adequate legal basis
for subject suspension.

4. The Joint Chiefs of Staff recommend that you secure

governmental acceptance of the position proposed in paragraph
2 above.
