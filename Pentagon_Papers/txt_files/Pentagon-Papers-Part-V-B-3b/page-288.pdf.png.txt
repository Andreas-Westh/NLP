‘Re DEPTEL 4023, paragraph 2D. _ ean

I would like to propose for consideration a radically different
epproacnh to the clarification of the full independence of the é
Associated States, and in particular of Vietnam. The estab~
lishment of the right of withdrawal from the French Union seems

to me to be a purely juridical approach, which does not go to
‘the roots of the problem. It is also unacceptable to French

opinion for a large number of reasons, among which are (1) that

-it throws into question the entire concept of the French Union

as a union of free and independent peoples, and (2) it casts
doubt on the veracity and honor of France in her recent state-
ments that Vietnam has now been granted full independence and,
subsequent to the granting of that independence, has chosen to
retain membership in the French Union.

The real problem to me seems to be how to establish in US and
Asian opinion the fact that the Associated States have, or will
have, a similar degree of independece to that possessed by
Indonesia, India, and Pakistan.’ I consider that the two basic
treaties resently negotiated between France and Vietnam (A)
granting full index pendence, and (B) establishing Vietnam's
membersnip in French Union do establish this type of indepsndsence
for Vietnas. However,. tHe situation 1s obscured and complicated
by the following factors: aa
