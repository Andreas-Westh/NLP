in conformity with the interests of Vietnam, France and their allies.

"Jo this end it appears highly desirable to the Prine Minister of France to
obtein the assurance of the United States Governnent that nothing will be done

by the latter which might even implicitly encourage such a reaction. Under

present circumstances such action could lead to no result but to ruin any hope

of seeing Vietnam consolidate herself in such a fashion as to create in the

ts

face of the Viet Minh an authentically national and independent force. Iti
for this reason that the French Government strongly hopes it can count on the >
United States at the proper moment to intervene with the Vietnamese to counsel
upon them wisdom and self-control and to dissuade them from refusing an agreement,
which, if it is reached, is dictated AOE by the spirit of abandoning them, but

on the contrary by the desire to save in Tdochina all that can possibly be
saved, and to give the Vietnamese state, under peaceful conditions, opportunities

which have not always been possible heretofore because of the war."
