FINALLY, MAURICE SCHUMANN TRANSHITTED. A REQUEST OF BIDAULT' ‘ha
THAT U.S. DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE iN THE NEAT DAYS TO ACCEL
ERATE DELIVERY OF PLANES AND EQUIPMENT IN THE EVENT THAT A
CEASE FIRE SHOULD BE NEGOTIATED AT GENEVA WHICH WOULD
NATURALLY BRING TO A HALT SUCH DELIVERIES.

I THEN REFERRED TO QUESTION OF LOCATION OF NEGOTIATIONS ae
EXPRESSED DEPT'S VIEWS IN FAVOR OF PARIS. SCHUMANN AND LAN:
AGREED THAT PARIS WOULD BE PREFERABLE TO WASHINGTON AND AC Con
INGLY IT CAN BE ACCEPTED AS AGREED THAT NEGOTIATIONS ALONG
LINES OF REFTEL WILL CONTINUE TO TAKE PLACE IN PARIS.

I THEN OUTLINED REQUIREMENTS LISTED IN PARAGRAPHS 2 AND

3 OF REFTEL. LANIEL AND SCHUMANN LISTENED VERY QUIETLY AND
SERIOUSLY AND ON THE WHOLE APPEARED WELL PLEASED WITH THIS
CLARIFICATION OF U.S. POSITION. THEY SAID THAT NATURALLY

. THEY DID NOT HAVE ANY INFO REGARDING THE VIEWS OF OTHER
COUNTRIES IN THE AREA AND THEY WOULD APPRECIATE BEING KEPT
INFORMED BY U.S. OF PROGRESS TOWARD FULFILLING CONDITION
INDICATED IN PARAGRAPH 2(B) WHICH WAS BEYOND THEIR CONTROL.
THEY WERE PARTICULARLY IMPRESSED AND PLEASED. BY INDICATION
IN THAT PARAGRAPH THAT ACTUAL PARTICIPATION BY UeKke WAS NO
LONGER A PREREQUISITE TO U.S. ACTION.

LANIEL AND SCHUMANN HAD ONE SERIOUS OBJECTION TO UeSe
CONDITIONS. THIS, AS EXPECTED, WAS TO THE CONDITION THAT
FRANCE PUBLICLY ACCORD TO ASSOCIATED STATES RIGHT OF WITHDRAVAL
_FROM FRENCH UNION AT ANY TIME. WHEN I EXPLAINED UeSe
“REASONS FOR THIS POSITION AS OUTLINED IN DEPTEL 4964, THEY
SAID THEY COULD SEE HOW SUCH A STATEMENT MIGHT BE OF SOME
HELP WITH NEHRU BUT THAT FRENCH PUBLIC OPINION WOULD NEVER
UNDERSTAND WHY IT WAS NECESSARY TO MAKE SUCH A STATEMENT
WHEN IT HAD NEVER BEEN REQUESTED BY ANY OF THE THREE ASSO-
CIATED STATES. THEY THEN POINTED OUT THE FACT THAT THE
VIET MINH ARMISTICE PROPOSALS, DISHONEST THOUGH THEY WERE,
NEVERTHELESS LOOKED TOWARD THE POSSIBILITY OF THE VIETMINA
JOINING THE FRENCH UNION. (COMMENTs I AM CERTAIN THAT
UNLESS WE CAN FIND SOME WAY TO GET AROUND THIS REQUIREMENT,
FRENCH WILL NEVER ASK FOR OUTSIDE ASSISTANCE.) AFTER |
HEARING STRONG STATEMENT ON THE SUBJECT BY BOTH LANIEL AND
SCHUMANN, I SAID THAT I HOPED WE COULD CONTINUE CONVERSATIONS
ON THIS SUBJECT IN ORDER TO FIND A FORMULA THAT WOULD SATISFY
U.S. REQUIREMENTS AND AT THE SAME TIME COULD BE ACCEPTED BY
THE FRENCH PARLIAMENT. LANIEL AND SCHUMANN AGREED THAT WE
SHOULD TALK FURTHER ON THIS SUBJECT. ;

LANIEL AND SCHUMANN HAD ONE OTHER QUESTION REFERRING TO SUB-
PARAGRAPH 2(E) WHICH STATES THAT FORCES FROM U.S. WOULD BE
