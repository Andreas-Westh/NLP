Dillon discovers that the U.S. complaints of not being
informed are proved unjustified on the French withdrawal
in Tonkin. Both State and Defense were notified via
Trapnell's hand-carried plans and diplomatic cables.
Public statements thus "can only serve to make our

- position here vis-a-vis Mendes and his goverrmment in-

creasingly difficult and undermine the confidence of
both the French Government and people in our candor..."

ment...there is a certain lack of intimacy..." in re-

to leave representation at Geneva but notBedell Smith

nor Dulles will return. The U.S. should avoid a

"position at Geneva..." Dulles 85 to Paris, 8 July

President Fisenhower and Secretary Dulles indicate

firmly to President Mendes-Franece the rationale
behind not sending Dulles or General Smith beck to :
Geneva. Essentially, the rationale is based on fail-
ure of the U.S., U.K. and Frence to agree on a joint

position at Geneva and lack of agreement on a

"wmited action" proposal if the position is not

accepted by the communists. Dulles sees France and

U.K. enhancing a communist â€œwhittling-away" process

by reedily accepting less than the seven points. :

French bargaining position weaker and (2) that Europe
would interpret U.S, absence from Geneva as a step
in the "return to a policy of isolationism." .
