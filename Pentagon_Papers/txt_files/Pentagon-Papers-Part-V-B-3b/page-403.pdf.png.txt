solution was simple. Withdraw invading Vietminh forces and let
dissident elements elect communist representatives to general
assemblies if they wished. But the elections must be actually
"free". Regarding Viet Nam, I said we recognized relative strength
of the Vietminh but theywere demanding too much. It seems Vietminh
demanded all Delta, including both Hanoi and Haiphong. The French
were our allies, and we took grave view of this extreme pressure.
Molotov said that if French were to have something in Sought and
something in North, and probably in center as well, this would add
up to three-quarters of country or better, which was wholly unreason-
able. He said there was old Russian proverb that if you try to chase
two rabbits at once you are aptto miss both of them, and added that
in this case wanting something in North and in Sough was like chasing
two rabbits. If French were to give way to Vietnimh in North, they
would gain territory probably greater in extent in Sought im recompense,
I said appearance of "partition" was repugnant to US, and that as
far as proverb about rabbits went I felt that Vietminh were chasing
two rabbits in wanting both Hanoi and Haiphong. Vietminh demands
for all the Delta, or efforts take it all by force prior to reaching

political solution through elections, was serious
