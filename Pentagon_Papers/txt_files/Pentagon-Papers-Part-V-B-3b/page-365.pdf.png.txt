for US assistance in Indochina unless government can at least
make strong inference that Marines will be sent to Indochina.

Thus, most crucial part of present Rrancocts neg zotiations from
both military and political point of view would seem to b
conversations Val luy is carrying on at Pentagon.

Tf our JCS takes position that US has not (repeat 466) the -:
military power to be able to afford the commitment of even ore
Marine division to Tonkin delta, French will draw the obvious
conclusion that arguments which force JCS to such a conclusion
apply with approximately five-fold effect to France. This will
push them irresistlbly toward abandonment of Indochina. Thus

jif we want French military assistance in showdown with Communists

in Southeast Asia it is in my opinion vltal that JCS find it
possible to erpr eve a jolnt war plan justit fying the use of
Marines. ' . hi Ley
