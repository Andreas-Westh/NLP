One aspect of the maneuvers in China ofthe imperialistic
powers which has struck me since the beginning of my sojourn
here is the assistante rendered to them (especially to the
British) by American lend lease. The British intelligence
and other agencies in China are supplied by air in lend lease
planes. General A. Carton de Wiart, Personal Representative
of Mr. Churchill and head of most of the widespread British
intelligence system in China, has a personal American lend

‘lease plane. It has beon my observation that British agents

here are opposed--some of them frankly so--to our policy of
working for a strong, united and democratic China, China is
not, of course, the only part of the world in which Amorican
lend leese has been used, is being used and will be used for

the purpose of defeating the principles for which we profess

to be fighting this war. I do not blame the British or other
lend lease beneficiary governments for employing lend lease

or other aid to attain their ends. I feel that it is at

least in part our fault that they are able so to do, From

my observations in China I am of the opinion that responsibility
for this situation rests in considerable measure upon ourselves
for failure to implement concretely the policy to which we are -
committed. The apparent continuing leck of affirmative

American policy on the question of the future status of
Indochina will eventually result in a vitiation of what I
understand to be among the fundamentals of our war aims

insofar as note country is. concerned. Z
