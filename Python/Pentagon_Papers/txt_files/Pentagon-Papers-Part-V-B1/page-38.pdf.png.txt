FOREIGN RELATIONS, 1943, CHINA

I am convinced that nothing could more seriously hinder their coop-
eration with the Allies than for ths liberation of Indochina to appear
to be entrusted, even provisionally, to Chinese formations which, in
the present; case, would appear to them not only as the advance guard
of the hereditary enemy of Annam and Tonkin, but as the direct
descendants of the bands of pirates and Jolly Rogers who have so
long caused the threat of their exactions to weigh upon those regions.
Just as American or English troops would be welcomed as allies and
liberators, so we run the risk of seeing French and natives react
strongly against the use of these Chinese elements. I do not believe
that a more scrious political and psychological fault could be com-
mitted and I take the liberty to beg you to call this point again to the
very serious attention of the competent authorities.$
