For the time being, however, France's concern in

the Far Zast is mainly military. As early as June 1943,
the French Committee of National Liberation made it known
to its allies that it considered that zone as one where it
would be extremely desirable for all the interested parties
to set uv a thorough military collaboration. On the 4th
ef October 1943, it decided to form an Expeditionary Force
that would take part in western Pacific operations and in
the liberation of Indochina, In the meanwhile the French
Government has established in Indochina itself a network of
-connections with the French and Indochinese underground.

By this action, the efficacity of which has been proved by
the French Forces of the Interior in France, it will
support the assault of the forces attacking from without
and help them in their task ina way that can be decisive,

â€˜The French Government has informed Washington and
London of all the measures it has taken in that respect.
It asked several times that the Expeditionary Forees should
be sent on the spot and used to the best; but the answer
was that the decision belonged to President Roosevelt and
the Combined Chiefs of Staff. This agreement has not yet
been given. Yet, the French Government is prepared to have
its expeditionary forces used on the Amorican as well as
on the British theatre of operations. Considering there-
fore the part France is entitled to ask and ready to take
\in the military operations in the Pacific, it would be
advisable that she should be admitted to the Pacific War -
Council and particularly to the Sub-Committee responsible
for the operations involving French I eaclgioay ds
