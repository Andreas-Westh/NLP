HELOnANDUM On Thi cnxUSIDENT
Subject: Indo-China.

Comnunications have been received from the Provisional
Government of the trench BoD epELe asking for;

(1) f&ssistence for the resistance groups now
fishting the Japsnese in Indo-China.

(2) Conclusion of a civil affairs agreement
covering possible future operations in Indo-China.

These memoranda heve been referred to the Joint
Chiefs of Steff in order to obtain their views concerning
the military aspects of the problems, end I shall conmiuivni-
. cete with you further on the subject upon receipt of the
Joint Chiefs' reply.

Attached herewith is the text of a recent telegram
from ambassador Ceffery describing his conversation with
General de Gaulle on the subject of Indo-China. From
this telegram ond de Geulle's speech of March lh, it
appears that this Government may be made to appear respon-
sible for the weakness of the resistance to Japen in
Indo-China. The British may likewise be expected to
encourage this view. It seems to me thet without prej-
udicing in any way our position regarding the future of
Indo-China we can combet this trend by making public our
' Gdesire to render such assistance as may be warranted by
the circumstances and by the plans to vhich we are already
committed in the Pacific area, To this end I attach a
Greft- of a sug vested statement for publication, subject
to your epprovol, by the State Depertment.
