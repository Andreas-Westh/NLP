THE ACTING SECRETARY OF STATE TO THE AMBASSADOR
IN JAPAN (GREW)+

/Paraphras?/

Washington, August 6, 1940
3 l p.m.

293. News agencies have carried reports that Japan has
made secret demands on France regarding Frerch Indo-
china. As reported, these demands include pvight on
part of Japan to move armed forces of dJspan through
that French possession, the right of armed forces of
Japan to use air bases at certain points there, etc.

The statements given by the Secretary cf State to
the press on April 17 and May 11, 1940, set forth this
rovernment's belief that (1) intervention in the domestic
arfairs of the Netherlands East indies, or (2) any
alteration, by other than peaceful processes, in their
status quo would be prejudicial ts the cause of security,
‘Sbability, and peace in the entire Pacific area, not
just in the region in avestion. Also, there was set
forth tne observation of the Government of the United
States that tne belief restated in the preceding sentence
was based on a doctrine of universal application and
that it is a doctrine unequivocaily supported by this
Government. The same belief and the same observation
naturélly apply to French Indochina likewise. This
Governnent is seriously perturhed, tharefore, over the

ddmarche which it is reported thas the Government of
Japan has made to the French authorities.

If no objestion is perceived, it is my desire that
at your early convenience you call upon se Minister
for Foreign Affairs and thah you express to him, as
under instructicn frem vour Government and alang the
lines ebove indicated, the concern felt by the Govern-
ment of the United States regarding the reported
developments.
