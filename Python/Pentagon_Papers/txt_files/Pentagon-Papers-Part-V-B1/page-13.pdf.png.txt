Washington, August 6, 1940.

STRICTLY CONFIDE PIDENTIAT,

Acting upon your instructions, I called on the
French Ambassador this morning and gave him the oral
reply which you have formulated to the Ambassador's
aide-mémolre of August 6th, on the subject of the demands
made by the Japanese Government upon the French
nie aes with regard to authorization to-.send troops
across Indochina, to use the local air fields in Indo-
china, to station forces at the air fields for the
purpose of assuring their security, and to send planes,
munitions, and all necessary material through Indochina
déstined to the Japanese Army.

I told the French Ambassador that we have been
doing and are doing everything possible within the frame-
work of our established policies to keep the situation
in the Far East stabilized; that we have been progressive-
‘ly taking various steps, the effect of which has been
to exert economic pressure on Japan; that our Fleet
is now based on Hawaii, and that the course which we have
been following, as indicated above, gives a clear
indication of our intentions and activities for the
future. I also raised with the French Ambassador the
question whether it would be practicable for the French
to delay discussions with the Japanese with respect
to Indochina for a period. I furthermore told the
Ambassador that the British Ambassador had been in-
formed of this matter by you in a most strictly
confidential manner and that if the British had any
observations or comments to make we would transmit
them immediately to the French Ambassador.

Count de Saint-Quentin stated that he felt that
this reply to the French request for assistance and
Support in her negotiations with Japan would very
