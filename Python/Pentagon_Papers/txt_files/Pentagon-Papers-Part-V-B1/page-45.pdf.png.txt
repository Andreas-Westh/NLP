FOREIGN RELATIONS, 1944, VOLUME Il

In his broadcast to the French people on November 8° the Presi-
dent said:

“We assure you that once the menace of Germany and Italy is
removed from you, we shall quit your territory at once.”

8. The preamble of the unpublished Clark—Darlan Agreement of
November 22, 1942,°* contains the following words:

“Tt has been agreed by all French elements concerned and United
States military authorities that French forces will aid and support
the forces of the United States and their allies to expel from the soil

of Africa the common enemy, to liberate France and restore integrally
the French Empire.”

THE VAR

Prime Minister Churchill has more than once expressed the desire
to see France, including Alsace-Lorraine, restored, and both Mr.
Churchill and Mr, Eden ** have repeatedly denied any territorial am-
bitions on the part of Great Britain with respect to the French
Empire.

1. On June 10, 1941, the Prime Minister assured the House of
Commons * that

“We have no territorial designs in Syria or anywhere else in French
territory”;

and subsequently, on November 10, 1942, he said: **

“For ourselves we have no wish but to see France free and strong,
with her empire gathered round her and with Alsace-Lorraine re-
stored. We covet no French territory. We have no acquisitive de-

’ signs or ambitions in North Africa or any other part of the world.”

_. These commitments, ‘however, are not interpreted by the British
Government as including any guarantee of particular frontiers or of
the integrity of the French Empire. The British Foreign Secre-
tary, in a letter to the American Ambassador on November 16, 19425
stated:

’ “You will see that we have taken care to avoid guaranteeing the
integrity of the French os and have concentrated upon assert-
ing our intention to restore ‘the independence and greatness of France’
and denying any desire to annex French territory”.
