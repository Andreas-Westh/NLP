to General Henri Giraud

November 2, 1942

The General:

Referring to the declaration made on several
Occasions by President Roosevelt, and the obliga-
tions already undertaken by the American Govern-
ment as well as by the British Governuent, I am
able to assure you that the restoration of France
to full independence, in all the greatness and
vastness which it possessed before the war in
Europe es well as overseas, is one of the war aims
of the United Nations. :

It is thoroughly understood that French
sovereignty will be re-established as soon as pos-
Sible throughout 211 the territory, metropolitan
and colonial, over which flew the French flag in 19539.

The Government of the United States considers <
the French nation as an ally and will treat it as such.

May I add further thÃ©t in case of mlitary
operations in French territory (whether in stints ie
France or in the Colonies) in all instances wher
French collaboration may be found, the American
authorities will not intervene in any way in those
affairs which are solely within she province of te
national administration or which have to do with the
exercise of French SON oral ety
