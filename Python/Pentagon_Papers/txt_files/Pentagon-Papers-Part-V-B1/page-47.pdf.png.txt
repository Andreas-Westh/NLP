Memorandum by the Under Secretary of State (Stettinius) to
President Roosevelt

[Wasuincton,] February 17, 1944.

The Civil Affairs Division of the War Department has indicated
its desire to proceed at once with civil affairs planning for Indo-
China and before doing so has requested political guidance from the
State Department.

A number of important decisions depend upon whether French
troops are to be used in the military operations to regain control of
Indo-China, and whether I'rench nationals are to be used in civil
administration and planning. There is ample evidence that the
French hope to be consulted and to play a part in driving the Japa-
nese from that area.

Subject to your approval, the State Department will proceed on
the assumption that French armed forces will be employed to at
least some extent in the military operations, and that in the adminis-
tration of Indo-China it will be desirable to employ French nationals
who have an intimate knowledge of the country andits problems. We
would assume further that the use of French forces or civilians would
be without prejudice to the question of the ultimate status of French
Indo-China and would be related solely to problems directly con-
nected with and flowing frorn possible military operations.
