THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
WASHINGTON

JUL 9 1954

Dear Mr. Murphy:

I refer to my letter of June 19th regarding U. S. assistance
to the French in the formation and equipping of three light infantry
divisions for use in Indo-China. The evaluation referred to in that
letter has been prepared by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, as set forth
in the attached memorandum, with which I concur.

Since no additional indication of French intentions has been
received in the Department of Defense and the new Premier has prom-
ised to end the war in Indo-China by 20 July or resign, I shall
leave to you the timing of any additional U. &. actions which may
be desired. I desire to point out, however, that in the event a
formal request is received there is, in addition to the points con-
tained in the Joint Chiefs of Staff memorandum, the additional
problem raised by Section 106a(1) of the Mutual Security Act of 195)
(Richards Amendment), as approved by the Committee on Foreign Affairs,
which could bar the United States from replacing this equipment.

In the event that you determine that this French plan is worthy
of further action, I suggest that the above point be included in
those requiring resolution since the impact on NATO of the removal
of equipment, if permanent, would be considerable.

Sincerely yours

(Signed)

R. B. ANDERSON
