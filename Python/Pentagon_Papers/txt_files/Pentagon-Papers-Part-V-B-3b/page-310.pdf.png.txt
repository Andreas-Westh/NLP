have to be taken to strengthen our allies. However, due to the
overriding mobilization requirements for U.S. forces, such

aid would be limited to those allies who could directly support
the U.S. strategic concept for general war. This aid would
further be limited to combat essential material, essential
replacements, and spare parts which are beyond the capabilities
of the individual countries to provide from their own or other
allied resources.

ASSUMING THE CHINESE COMMUNISTS DO NOT INTERVENE

9. Strategie Concept and Plan of Action

Seek to create conditions by destroying effective Commu-
nist forces in Indochina, under which the Associated States
Forces could assume responsibility for the defense of Indochina.
In the light of this concept, the major courses of action which
would be undertaken are as follows: :

a. Conduct air operations in support of allied forces in

Indochina. The employment of atomic weapons is contemplated
in the event that such course appears militarily advantageous.

b. Simultaneously, French Union Forces augmented by such
armed forces of the Philippines and Thailand as may be com-
mitted would, in coordination with U.S. naval and Air Force
forces, conduct coordinated ground, naval and air action to
destroy enemy forces in Indochina.

10. Forces Required of Each Nation Participating

The forces which would be employed under current plans
during the initial phases of the above operation would include:

a French Union Forces currently operating in Indochina,

|
b. A U.S. Fast Carrier Task Force and supporting forces

as necessary in accordance with developments in the situation.

c. U.S. Air Force units operating from present bases outside
Indochina as required.

d. Forces as may be contributed by other friendly nations,

The duration of commitment of these forces cannot be determined
at this time.
