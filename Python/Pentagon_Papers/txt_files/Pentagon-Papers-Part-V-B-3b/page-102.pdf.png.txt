15. As I stated in a bricf memorandum to the President, copy at-
tached as Enclosure "HB", ] am gravely fearful that the rncasures being
unde rtaken by the French will prove to be inadequate and initiated too ite
to prevent a progressive deterioration ef the situation in Indo-China, If
Dien Eien Phu is lost, this dcterioration may occur very rapidly duc to
the loss of morale among the mass 6g the native population. In such a
situation only prompt and forceful intervention by the United States could

avert the loss of all of South East Asia to Communist domination. 1 am

convinced that the United States must be prepared to take such action
