Delivery of letter of type indicated in reference telegram

at this time, in the midst of crucial France-US negotiations
on Indochina, would in my opinion not have effect of exerting
pressure on French, but would simply ensure defeat or in-
definite postponement of EDC and would greatly strengthen
group in French Government favoring peace at any price in
Indochina. :

By June 1 situation should be much clearer and then if, after
further conversations with Laniel, there still should be no
progress on EDC I feel that the time would be ripe to consider
seriously the delivery of a formal letter regarding intentions
to the French. Status of Indochina crisis will, however, still
have to be taken into consideration in reaching our final de-
cision. Meanwhile I suggest that our action be limited to

oral communications by me regarding importance of EDC to
Schumann or Laniel or both the next time I see them regarding
Indochina.
