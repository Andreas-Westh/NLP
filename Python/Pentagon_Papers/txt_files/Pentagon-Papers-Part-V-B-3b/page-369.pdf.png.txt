EYES ONLY FOR AMBASSADORS

Ambassador bonnet came to see Secretary Dulles Wednesday
afternoon and raised question of participation of US Marines Indochina.
He said he had received telegram from Maurice Schumann expressing excite-
ment and dismay at information from Valluy that Radford had said there was
no rpt no question of utilization Marines Indochina. Ambassador said this
conflicted with what French Govt had hitherto understood to be intentions
US Govt this respect. He further stated suggestion made by Radford to
Valluy that three Korean divisions might be used in Indochina was unacceptable.
Secretary said US position had been clear from start and that we were

not rpt not willing to make commitment ahead of time which French could use
for internal political maneuvering or negotiating at Geneva and which would
represent a kind of permanent option on US intervention if it suited
their purpose. A month ago, French had been explicitly informed conditions
which mist be met and fulfilled by them before President took decision
whether to go to Congress and ask for authority use American armed forces in
relation Indochina. Among these conditions was need for French and
Associated States to request US and certain other interested countries to come

in. We were still in dark as to what French intentions really were.
