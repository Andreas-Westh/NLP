: 6. Gencrat Ely expressed the vice that ritlttery DG REE nes
total military wiereny were to be expected in 1954-1955, with the presently
prograrmmed resources in pursuance of the Navarre Plan. He considers
the problem in Indo-China to be political as well ns military. Ultimate
victory will require the independence of the. Resocinied States, develop-
ment of a strong indigenous army, manning ahd defending the Candee
frontier and commitment of resources greatly in excess of those which

France can supply. He envisages some sort of coalition by the nations

of Sy. by. Asia,

7. Asa result of the foregoing conferences 1am gravely fearful that
_the measures being taken by the French will prove to be inadequate and
initiated too late to prevent.a progressive deterioration of the situation,
The consequences can well lead to the loss of all of S. E, Asia to Com-
munist dornination. .If this is to be avoided, I consider that the U.S. must
be pre pared to act promptly and in force possibly to a frantic and belated

request by the French for U.S. intervention,
