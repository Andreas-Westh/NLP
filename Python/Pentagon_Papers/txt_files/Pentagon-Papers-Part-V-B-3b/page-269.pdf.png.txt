steps as it then felt were necessary. Consideration must be given to what
steps could be taken if we withdraw from a conference which we helped
initiate and of which we were an inviting Power. If such steps to be
contemplated include any direct military action in the area, the U.S,

would be risking being called an "aggressor" if it tried to take action

of this sort while the Conference was still in session. Para. 29 of ‘
NSC 5405, the approved policy on Southeast Asia, states "If the French
actually enter into negotiations with the Communists, insist that the
United States be consulted and seek to influence the course of the nego-
tiations." You presumably will want to discuss this comment of paragraph 7
with Admiral Radford.

In case you want to send a written reply to Mr. Murphy we attach a
draft. Note that it says you have discussed it with Admiral Radford who
agrees. We have not shown it to Admiral Radford so you should do so before
sending it (his office has been given a copy). Also note it questions the
need for sending eny such instructions on "posture" at this late date.
