SENT TO: Amconsul GENEVA TEDUL 212 PRIORITY

From your DULTE 187 it is evident that QUOTE underground
military talks UNQUOTE, even more than conference proceedings,
are pointing toward de facto partition under conditions such
that Communist take-over of al]. Vietnam looms ahead clearly.

Chauvel's mention of difficulty of QUOTE selling UNQUOTE
Vietminh proposal to Vietnamese and his doubt that Hanoi-
Haiphong area can be held indicate to us that French may end by
accepting any Vietminh proposition which offers hope of.
extricating Expeditionary Corps. In this eonnection we note
failure of Vietminh thus far to react to French question
regarding evacuation French troops and citizens and Vietnamese
Catholics.

There can of course be no repeat no question of US
participation in any attempt to QUOTE sel] UNQUOTE a partition

to non-Communist Vietnamese.
