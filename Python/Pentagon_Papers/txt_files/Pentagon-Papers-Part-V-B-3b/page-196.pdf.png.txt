MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE

Subject; U.S. Reaction to Chinese Communist
Introduction of Air Power in Indochina

1. The Joint Chiefs of Staff have reviewed a memorandum by
Department of State Representatives, dated 12 March 1954, sub-
ject as above, tabled at the 12 March 1954 State-JCS meeting.
In substance, this memorandum requested the Joint Chiefs of
Staff to present their views on the military Siena sues and
implications of the following:

a. The appearance of, and Communist capability of
maintaining and supplying, an air force using only
airfields in Viet Nam or Laos in the face of French
opposition.

b. The appearance of, and Communist capability of
mounting, an air force based principally on airfields
in Communist China, and how large a force would be
required to counter French defense capabilities.

2. In regard to subparagraph 1 a, above, there are no in-
dications that the Viet Minh currently possess an air force.
Therefore, the appearance of combat aircraft in Minh would
warrant the assumption that they were supplied by and operated
from Communist China. It is estimated that the Communists,
in the face of current French capabilities, could not maintain
and supply an air force operating exclusively from airfields
in Viet Nam or Laos.

3. In regard to subparagraph 1 b, above, the Communists
have the capability of mounting a ersious air threat to the
French with an airforce based principally in South Cina.

The French air defense of the Indochina area is inadequate.
Consequently, a Communist air force of from 100-200 aircraft
(including jet bombers) could readily overcome French air
strength in the Tonkin delta and severely affect estes French
strengths in Indochina.
