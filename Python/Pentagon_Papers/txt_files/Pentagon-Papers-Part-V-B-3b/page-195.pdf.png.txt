4. Should the Communists operate an air force from South
China in sufficient strength to jeopardize French retention
of the Tonkin delta, the resulting situation would warrant
active consideration of implementation of appropriate actions
as outlined in paragraph 31 of NSC 5405. If and when the in-
troduction of Communist aircraft into the Indochina War ap-
pears imminent, the U.S. should initiate talks at a political
level as set forth in NSC 5405 to provide for the implementa-
tion of the military actions outlined in paragraph 31 of NSC
5405.

5. Although there is no reliable evidence to indicate that
Communist combat air units, POL, or other aviation supplies
have been moved in strength to South China, this could be
accomplished without too much difficulty. However, until there
is some indication of such an enemy development, the Joint
Chiefs of Staff are of the opinion that any commitment which
restricts or limits freedom of action by the United States
would be premature and unwarranted. Accordingly, the Joint
Chiefs of Staff recommend that the reply to Mr. Pleven indi-
cate that United States action in such a development would de-
pend upon the circumstances.

6. The Joint Chiefs of Staff will acquaint Department of
State Representatives with the substance of their views as
expressed in this memorandum when the subject of Indochina
is again discussed at a State-JCS meeting.

For the Joint Chiefs of Staff:
Signed

ARTHUR RADFORD,
Chairman,
Joint Chiefs of Staff.
