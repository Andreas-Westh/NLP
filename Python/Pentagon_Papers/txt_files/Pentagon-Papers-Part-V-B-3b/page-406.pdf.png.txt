unacceptable to Eden, Bidault and me, are highly
significant. The recent emphasis by all three Communist
spokesmen that France should earry on direct political as
well as direct military negotiations with Vietminh show
their interest in having a convenient way of holding out
for greater gains in their direct negotiations with the
French as well as within the framework of the Conference.
Molotov in effect told France in his June 8 speech that
her position and that of the Government she was supporting in
Indochina were hopeless and that she had best face up to facts
and capitulate in direct negotiations with the Vietminh. His
speech, of course, was in large part intended to assist in
the destruction of the French Government for the implications that
that would have on the European as well as the Asiatic
scene. Nevertheless, his harsh and even insulting language
seemed to reflect the confident, nearly triumphant mood in
which he has been lately. It would be misleading to ascribe
the harder line which Molotov brought back with him from
Moscow entirely to Soviet tactical considerations in regard
to the French Government crisis. While the Soviets may
think that the blocking of EDC through the destruction of
the French Government would reduce future threats to them
in Europe, the fact remains that the Indochina conflict

potentially involves a much more immediate threat
