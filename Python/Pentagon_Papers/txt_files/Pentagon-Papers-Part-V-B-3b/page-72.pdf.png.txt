Visit of Lieutenant General John W. O'Daniel to Vietnamese Defense

Minister, 1 February 1954 at Saigon.

I called on the Minister of National Defense of Vietnam, Dr. Pham
Huy Quat, accompanied by the Deputy Chief of Mission who served as in-
terpreter.

Dr. Quat told me that the plan for augmentation of the Vietnamese
national forces had been approved by the High Military Committee at its
meeting on January 18. This called for an increase of 66 battalions in
1954, plus 16 specialized companies. However, Dr. Quat had proposed a
new system of accelerating the increase of the Vietnamese National Army.
This consisted in drawing on the local militia as the initial base for
recruitment to the light battalions, and the light battalions, in turn,
would serve as the base for filling out the regular battalions. Dr. Quat
felt that, by the adoption of his system, it would be possible to decrease
the present training cycle of four months to only two months. He said
that if his system were adopted (and stated that it had already received
the approval of Bao Dai) he could raise 130,000 additional troops in the
current calendar year.

The Minister of National Defense said that one of his great Seer end
was that of cadres. There simply were not enought officers of field -
grade to go round. He had an absolute ceiling limitation of 800 Fre ch
officers for the Vietnamese National Army, and a large proportion of. these
were employed in training activities. If, by chance, he could secure
American officers as instructors, this would liberate an equivalent numâ€”

ber of French officers for combat service.
