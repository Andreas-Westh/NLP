PRINCIPALLY AIR AND SEA "AND OTHERS*®. THEY ASKED ME TO

FIND OUT WHAT WAS MEANT BY OTHER FORCES. LANIEL INDICATED
THAT IT WOULD BE VERY IMPORTANT TO HAVE ARTILLERY FORCES

AS WELL AS SOME GROUND FORCES. IN THIS CONNECTION, THEY
MENTIONED THE POSSIBILITY OF THE USE OF MARINES. COMMENT:

I FEEL THAT WHILE FRENCH GOVT WOULD NOT LOOK FORWARD IN PRE-
SENT CIRCUMSTANCES TO THE NECESSITY OF ANY SUBSTANTIAL IN-
VOLVEMENT BY U.S. GROUND FORCES, THEY NEVERTHELESS FEEL THAT
IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE PROVIDE AT LEAST SOME TOKEN
GROUND FORCES SO THAT OUR PARTICIPATION IS NOT LIMITED
STRICTLY TO NAVAL AND AIR FORCES.)

BOTH LANTEL AND SCHUMANN ACCEPTED WITHOUT QUESTION AS BEING
WHOLLY JUSTIFIED UeS. REQUIREMENT THAT CONDITIONS BE ACCEPTED
BY FRENCH CABINET AND ENDORSED BY NATIONAL ASSEMBLY. THEY THEN
SAID THAT THEY WOULD PROBABLY WANT TO SPEAK TO ME OVER THE
WEEKEND AFTER THEY HAD HAD TIME TO THINK FURTHER REGARDING .
U.S. CONDITIONS. I MADE IT CLEAR THAT CONDITIONS AS OUTLINED
REPRESENTED PRESENT HIGH LEVEL THINKING IN WASHINGTON AND DID
NOT REPRESENT AS YET ANY COMMITMENT ON THE PART OF U.S.

GOVT. SCHUMANN THEN SAID THAT NEGOTIATIONS SHOULD BE PURSUED
IN THE GREATEST SECRECY UNTIL SUCH TIME AS FULL AGREEMENT HAD
BEEN REACHED. HE SAID THAT PREMATURE PRESS LEAKS COULD MAKE
THINGS MOST DIFFICULT AND HE REFERRED TO AN AP PRESS STORY

~ TODAY FROM WASHINGTON. LANIEL AND SCHUMANN THEN SAID THAT
THEY HOPED THAT NEGOTIATIONS COULD CONTINUE RAPIDLY AND THAT
WHEN AND IF FULL AGREEMENT HAD BEEN REACHED, WE WOULD BE IN

- A POSITION TO MAKE PUBLIC DECLARATION OF A SORT WHICH WOULD
INFLUENCE COMMUNIST NEGOTIATORS AT GENEVA.
