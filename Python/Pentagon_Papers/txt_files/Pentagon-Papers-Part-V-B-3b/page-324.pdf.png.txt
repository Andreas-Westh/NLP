Schumann has never asked me whether US response to a Chinese
attack would be subject to same conditions posed in Department
telegram 4023 and I have never, in any way, indicated to him
what the US requirements would be for reaction in such an ~
emergency except to point out that full clarification of the
independence of Vietnam would be most important. See Embassy
telegram 4580. :
