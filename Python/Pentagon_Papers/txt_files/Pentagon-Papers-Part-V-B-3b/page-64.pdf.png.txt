1. The attached report of my visit to Indochina, covers the results
accomplished, action taken, and recoumendations. The outstanding points
are covered herein.

2. During this visit I talked with General Navarre and other senior
French officials, as well as officials of the iieoneneee government, All
conversations were conducted in a spirit of frankness, with a free exchange

of views and information.

3. During my stay in Indochina I had two conferences with General
Navarre, in which we discussed the purpose of my visit and means and methods
by which I could be of assistance to him. Relative to establishing myself
in Indochina as a liaison officer to him, he emphasized that he did not
desire Usd overt participation at this level for political reasons but
that he would not object to periodic visits by me and my staff. We agreed
on my visiting Saigon at about six weeks! intervals. Navarre said we
could try this out and discuss the matter further at my next visit.

lh. In the field of psychological warfare, he was not particular) |
interested in U.S. participation. On the other hand, ths Viehianses are,
amenable to it.

5. General Navarre stated that while he felt some concern over the

making possible the recovery of more units that should give him a

trependerance of forces with which to strike the eneny. 3
