Following is outline given this morning by Chauvel to
Dennis, Allen and Achilles of proposal which Bidault
last night sent to French Cabinet for authorization to
make when substantive discussion of Indochina starts:

1. Vietnam problem is purely Vietnamese with no question
of partition, only military struggle for control of govern-
ment.

2. Situation different in Laos and Cambodia which are
victims of external aggression.

3. Under Berlin agreement, purpose of Geneva conference

is to establish peace in all three countries. To this end
there should be a cease-fire guaranteed by adequate military
and administrative controls under supervision. Cease-fire
would take effect only when such guarantees had been embodied
in armistice conventions, which might be different for each
three states, and when control machinery had been established
and was in place. Controls would be based upon Laniel's
March 5 conditions. When cease-fire occurred, regular troops
would be regrouped into delimited areas and all other forces
disarmed. The control machinery would be "international"

and would require considerable body of personnel.

4. After peace had been re-established by the cease-fire,
political and economic problems could be examined.

In discussing this draft proposal Chauvel said French
assumed Russians would propose immediate cease-fire followed

by political settlement based on coalition and immediate
elections, which would force West into position of opposing

cease-fire
