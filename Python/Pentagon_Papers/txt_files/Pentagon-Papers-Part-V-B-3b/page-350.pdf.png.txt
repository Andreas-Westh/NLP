Re numbered paragraph 3-C, it might make French declaration >
e more palateble both in France and in Asia generally were we

forgotten that in Communist and neutralist Asian eyes US is:
re. principal threat in Eastern Asia and not what Is generally re.
Z - garded to be a decadent France. Since Communist propaganda —.

Referenc e paragraph 4-A, it is essential that we commence
forthwith to review terms of reference which now limit MAAG
to purely. logistical function. Under present set of rules,
General O'Daniel is being asked to train Vietnamese troops
with ever present French “veto hanging over his head. In my
opinion, we should aoproach French Government on terms of
septemser 29, 1955 agreement, point out that Navarre plan ‘no
longer exists, that conditions have. changed, and that new
terms of reference for MAAG should be drat ted forthwith.
