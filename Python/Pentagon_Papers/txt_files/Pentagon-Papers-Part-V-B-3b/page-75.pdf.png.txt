experiment in the three provinces which had been entrusted largely to
Vietnamese hands would be of utmost importance in developing future
guidance in the realm of psychological warfare.

In response to my question, Dr. Quat likewise indicated that his
Ministry was preparing plans for training in guerrilla warfare. He was
interested in the suggestion, although it did not apply specifically to
Vietnam, that in the present conflict in middle Laos prompt action in
bringing Laotian guerrillas, backed up by regular battalions, to confront
the Viet Minh who had invaded that area might be successful in preventing
the Viet Minh from settling down in these remote jungles and mountains
and so establishing themselves that their eradication would prove a time-
consuming and difficult problem.

The over-all impression given by Minister Quat was one of quiet self-
confidence in his ability to get on with the war and to succeed in his
program, provided that he had sufficient backing from the French High
Command and if an increased amount of American aid, both in officer train-
ing instructors and in arms for his proposed militia, were forthcoming.

Acknowledgment for this detailed report of my meeting is made to

Mr. McClintock, Deputy Chief of Mission, American Embassy, Saigon.
