5, Control by the United Nations:
A. Of the cease-fire

B. Of the regroupment

C. Of the disarmament and the withdrawal 3
D. Of the administration of the entire country ar

BE. Of the general elections, when the United Nations believes
that order and security will have been everywhere truly restored,

This proposal made on the formal instructions of His Majesty Bao
Dai, and of the President Ngo Dinh Diem, shows that the chief of
state of Vietnam once more places the independence and the unity
of his country above any other consideration, and that the
national government of Vietnam would prefer this provisional UN
control over a truly independent and United Vietnam to its main-~
tenance in power in a country dismembered and condemned to
slavery.. ; °

- Vietnamese DEL renews its request that a conference session be
devoted to the study of its proposal for a cease-fire without
partition.

In adding this proposal to those of other members of the con-
ference, the DEL of the state of Vietnam means to bring a positive
contribution to the"search for a real and durable peace which
conforms to the aspirations of the Vietnamese people.
