inevitability of settling, on unacceptable terms. Hints
of possible U.S. participation would tend to fortify
French firmness, but might also tend to induce the Commu-
nists to put forward more acceptable terms.

c. On balance, it appears that the United States
should now reach a decision whether or not to intervene
with combat forces, if that is necessary to save Indo-
china from Communist control, and, tentatively, the form
and conditions of any such intervention. The timing for
communication to the French of such decision, Se FOr its
implementation, should be decided in the light of future
developments.

8. If the United States should now decide to intervene
at some stage, the United States eKeuld now take these steps:
a. Obtain Congressional approval of intervention.
b. Initiate planning of the military and mobiliza-
‘ tion measures to enable intervention.
[on Make publicized U.S. military moves designed
to make the necessary U.S. air and naval forces readily
‘available for use on short notice.
d. Make maximum diplomatic efforts to make it clear,
as rapidly as possible, that no acceptable settlement can
be reached in the absence of far greater Communist con-

cessions than are now envisaged.
