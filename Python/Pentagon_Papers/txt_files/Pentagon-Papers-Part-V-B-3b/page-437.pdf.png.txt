In going over file since drafting EMBTEL 75 we have determined
that Department as well as Defense were informed of French plans
to withdraw to inner perimeter of Tonkin delta on May 30. At
that time Generaly Ely handed General Trapnell, former chief 3
MAAG Saigon, who had been sent to Paris by General Ridgway to
take part in Indochina talks, copy of new Defense plan and per-
mitted Trapnell to make notes on it. EMBTEL 4605, repeated
Saigon as 418, Geneva as 560 for Chiefs of Mission and passed

to Defense for Ridgway informed Department of new plan in numbered>
paragraphs 4, 5 and 6. Details of plan were carried to Washington
few days later by Trapnell himself... “AY

plus what Department's own spokesman has been quoted as saying

can only serve to make our position here vis-a-vis Mendes and

ence of both the French Government and people in our own candor
