Secretary believes it is of overrriding importance to push on with action
on Thailand appeal, and to avoid getting bogged down in argumentation about
geographical scope of sub-commission activities. Nevertheless, it seems clear
UK and French will not agree to move along in SC ;ntil we have reached
understanding on this question. SECTO 366 and SECTO 371 indicate language
included TOSEC 229 and in Thai speech to SC June 3 should meet Eden's desire
that resolution not specifically (repeat specifically) extera scope of POC
beyond Thailand, while allowing actual observation to be extended later without
further SC or GA action. However, French delegation in NY has firmly contended
sub-commission must Be restricted to Thailand alone while British were most
concerned that there be no immediate ee by Laos and Cambodia for observation,
Since we now desire quick action, suggest you meet with Eden, Prince Wan
and Bidault to work out agreement which will permit delegations in NY to press
matter in SC. Hope we could get their agreement next meeting of SC should be

held preferably Friday and certainly not later than Monday or Tuesday, June 1)

or 15. Possibly they would agree on text contained TOSEC 229.
