1. We fully realize need for prompt decisions regarding international~
izing the war. Various factors combine to suggest that it may be premature
to pose issue of internationalizings for decision at this moment.

(a) If raised before French realize fully that choice is between
internationalizing and virtual surrender, proposal to internationalize might
well be rejected, leaving no alternative but capitulation.

() British are more likely to support or acquiesce in interven-
tion if Geneva has been shown to offer no prospect of solution.

(c) Australian govermnent would almost certainly not take a
position until after elections at end of May.

Even so it seems desirable for Laniel to know in general terms
conditions we would require for intervention because of influence on current
French decisions in military field in Indo-China and in political field in
Geneva.
