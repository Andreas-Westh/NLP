15. I called at General Cogny's Headquarters and had a profitable
talk with him. He is a fine officer and is Sound Has his thinking. He
is greatly concerned over having to send so much of his mobile reserve
from the Delta area. He stated that the enemy has increased infiltra-

continue until Navarre has more troops to continue the clearing of the
Delta or adopts a plan to wire in the Delta with tactical wire, covering
it with fire, and then conducts a deliberate campaign to eliminate all
enemy. I expressed these ideas to Cogny. He was non-committal but was
interested when I attempted to show him by a sketch how I thought fenc-

the political war had to be won before the military. I told him that I
did not agree at all with such a concept and that the military had to be
won first. I am sure that Cogny is of the same opinion that I am. Cogny
is anxious es stay in Indochina until the war is won, although he has been
there now for more than thirty months. Navarre has high regard for Cogny
and no doubt Cogny will stay. I certainly hope so.

the military definitely want to stay until the war is brought to a success-

ful conclusion. The French are sadly lacking in known-how in many fields,
