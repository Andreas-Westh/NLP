THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF hip CHAT EG

WASHINGTON 25, D.C,

20 May 1954

MEMORANDU?I FOR ‘THE SECRETARY OF DEPENSE
Subject: U.S. Military Participation in Indochina,

1. In recent discussions between the French and the Denart-
ment of State relating to U.S. military interventicn in Indo-
chine, the U.S. Government specified certain conditions which
would have to obtain if U.S. military Intervention were to be
undertaken. Among these conditions were:

a. chat France would undertake not to withdraw its
forces from Indochina during period of united action so
that forces from U.S. principally air and sea and others
would be supplementary and not in substitution;

b. That agreement would have to be reached on training
of native troops and on command structure for united action,

2. On the assumption that United States arnned forces inter-
vene in the conflict in Indochina, the Joint Chiefs of Staff
have agreed that a Department of Defense position should he
formulated as to the size and composition of U.S. force con-
tributions to be made and the conmand structure to be estah-
lished. In formulating these views the Joint Chiefs of Starr
have been guided by several factors, among which ave:

a. The limited availability of U.S. forces for military
action i1 Indochina.

b. The current numerical advantage of the French Union
forces over the enemy, 1.e., approx cimately 5) to 3.

ec. The undesirability of basing large numbers of U.S.
forces in Indochina,

ad. The primary need of an expanded end intensified train-
ing progron as being the current greatest need,
