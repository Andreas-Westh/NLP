REACTION TO AN ALL-OUT CHINESE ATR ATTACK WERE TWO VERY

' SEPARATE PROBLEMS, AND THAT SOME ARRANGEMENT SHOULD BE MADE TO
HANDLE A CHINESE ATR ATTACK IF IT SHOULD OCCUR PRIOR TO CREATION
OF A SEATO ALLIANCE,

IF WE SHOULD INFORM THE FRENCH THAT WE WILL NOT RPI NOT REACT

TO A CHINESE ATR ATTACK EXCEPT AFTER MAKING THE NECESSARY ARRANGE-
MENTS FOR COLLECTIVE ACTION, I- AM AFRATD THAT THIS WOULD HAVE

A PROFOUND AND IMMEDIATE EFFECT BOTH ON FRENCH ATTITUDE IN GENEVA
AND ON PRESENT FRENCH PLANS FOR BOLSTERING THE DEFENSE OF INDO-
CHINA. WE GAVE LANIEL GENERAL TRAPNELL'S OPINION THAT ELY'S
OVERALL PLAN SEEMED GOOD AND THAT FRENCH SHOULD BE ABLE TO HOLD
AREAS WHICH ELY PLANS TO DEFENS, ELY THEN ARRANGED FOR FURTHER
TECHNICAL DISCUSSION WITH TRAPNELL LATER IN MORNING, SEE
FOLLOWING TELEGRAM.
