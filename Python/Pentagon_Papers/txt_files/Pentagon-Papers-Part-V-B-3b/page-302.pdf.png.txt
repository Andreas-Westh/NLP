Your TRDUL. LO7. fy
I will advise Eden in accordance with your instructions and e
provide him with a confirming memorandum. Will omit paragraph ~!
four, since Australia and New Zealand have been informed and cs
are participating and our relationship to ANZUS is soe under- *
stood. ; yy e:

With regard to final paragraph of TEDUL 107, it is completely me,
impossible for me to understand the reasoning which prompts G
the decision by our Joint Chiefs of Staff that they should I
downgrade the rank of our representation on these five power ete
staff conferences. Regardless of the actual outcome, the G
simple fact that very senior military officers of the five G
powers were meeting in Washington would convince the Russians A
and Chinese, who inevitably would know about it, that, regard- .
less of protestations or statements to the contrary, we really
intended serious business. I really regret this decision more
than I can say.
