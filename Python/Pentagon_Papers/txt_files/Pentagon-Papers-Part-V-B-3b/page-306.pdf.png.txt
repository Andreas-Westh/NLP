MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE

Subject: Studies with Respect to Possible U.S.
Action Regarding Indochina

1. Reference is made to the memorandum by the Acting Secre-
tary of Defense, dated 186 May 1954, subject as above, wherein
the Joint Chiefs of Staff were requested to prepare certain
studies, and agreed outline answers to certain questions relat-
ing thereto, for discussion with the Acting Secretary of Defense
on or before 2k May, and for subsequent submission ae the
National Security Council (NSC).

2. a. The studies requested by the Acting Secretary of
Defense were developed within the parameters prescribed
in the memorandum by the Executive Secretary, NSC, dated
18 May 1954, subject as above. This memorandum is in-
terpreted as assuming no concurrent involvement in Korea.
This assumption may be quite unrealistic and lead to mal-
employment of available forces. The Joint Chiefs of Staff
desire to point out their belief that, from the point of
view of the United States, with reference to the Far East
as a whole, Indochina is devoid of decisive mulitary objec-
tives and the allocation of more than token U.S. armed
forces in Indochina would be a serious diversion of limited
U.S. capabilities. The principal sources of Viet Minh mili-
' tary supply lie outside Indochina. The destruction or
neutralization of these sources in China proper would
materially reduce the French military problems in Indochina.

b. In connection with the above, it may be readily
anticipated that, upon Chinese Communist intervention in
Indochina, the French would promptly request the immediate
deployment of U.S. ground and air forces, additional naval
forces, and a considerable increase in MDAF armament and
equipment. The Joint Chiefs of Staff have stated their
