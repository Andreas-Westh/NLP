146. General Smith and Molotov conduct lengthy conversations
on "making positions clear." The Soviet tactics were
probably to forestall U.S. intervention in the Delta by

negotiations was raised. DULTE 202, 19 June 195h..........-.. 580

149. A French aide-memoire indicates the French objective to
seek a de facto division which leaves a solid territory
for the State of Vietnan and further requests that the
U.S. do nothing to encourage an anticipated "violent
and unreasoning" reaction on the part of Vietnamese
patriots who object to an indefinite period of division
of the country. Dulles 4852 to Paris, 28 June 1954.......... 593

150. French negotiations with Viet Minh are stalled and Mendes-

153. The French speak most firmly to the Viet Minh that the
proposal for demarcation along the thirteenth parallel
is unacceptable. On Soviet interest in the line, the
French threaten that the line they propose is acceptable
to the rest of the conference and thus everts the "risk
of internationalization of the conflict." SECTO 557,
