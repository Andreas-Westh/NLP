air and naval action against all suitable military tar-
gets in China which directly contribute to the war in
Indochina, avoiding insofar as practicable targets near
the USSR boundaries

all-out war with Communist China, and possibly with the USSR

and the rest of the Soviet bloc, and should therefore proceed

to take large-scale mebilization me ASUTEeS.
