SUBJECT: Military Implications of the U. 5, Position on
Jndochina in Geneva

1. The attached se ES and recommendations concerning
the U. S. position in Geneva have been developed by a Sub-
committee consisting of a AAR ee of the Department
of Defense, JCS, State, and CIA.

2. ‘Thus eae reflects the conclusions of the Depart-
ment of Defense and the JCS and has been collaborated with
the State Denartaent representatives who have reserved
their position thereon.

3. In brief, this paper concludes that from the point
of view of the U. S. strategic position in Asia, and indeed
throughout the world, no solution to the Wndochiha problem
short of victory is acceptable. It recommends that this be
‘the basis for the U. S. negotiating Poeitscu prior to and
at the Geneva Conference,

4, It also notes that, aside from the improvement of
the present military situation in Indochina, none of the
courses of action considered provide a satisfactory solution
to-:the Indochina war. .

5. The paper notes that the implications of this posi-
tion are such as to merit consideration by the NSC and the
President.

6. I reeommend that the Special Comittee note and
approve this report and forward it with the official Depart-.
ment of State views to the NSC
