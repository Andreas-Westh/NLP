6, I presented to General Ely our views in regard to expanding the \
MAAG to assist the French in training the Victnamese, indicating to him
the faaperience which ne attach to this action, first, to obtain better re-

; s
sults, secondly to release French officers for combat service, General
Ely was most unsympathetic to any extconchment on French responsibili-
tics or significant expdnsion of the MAAG, The reasons given related to
French "prestige", possible lack of confidence in French leadership by the
Vietnamese, "the political situation in France" etc, The only commitments
I was able to get from General Ely were; Si

a. He would urge General Navarre to be most sympathetic
to the advice given by the officers recently assigned io MAAG
(such as Colonel Rosson),

b. He would request General Navarre to discuss the utiliza-
tion of U.S, etatt officers with General O'Daniel tied the spot ina
broad, understanding and comprehensive manner", I would make
a similar request of General O'Danicl.

«

c. He would make some informal soundings in Paris on the
subject of increased U.S. participation in training and would com-
municate further with me « informally - through General Valluy.

I conclude that the French are disposed firmly to resist any delegation

of training responsibilities to the U,S, MAAG.
