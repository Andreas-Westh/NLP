FOR THE SECRETARY FROM THE UNDER SECRETARY

I had long talk with Mendes-France this afternoon, as I told

you. He urgently asked that we expand our proposed unilateral i
declaration so as take note not (repeat not) only of agree- as
ments between military commands, but also take note of para- . G
graphs one to nine proposed conference declaration. (See t
SECTOs 628 ani 647). I made it clear that we could under no

nine ef conference declaration if its final content does—nee |/_—;.

am sure J]-know what would be acceptable to you. JI will, of
course, have to state in conference that the US is unable to. “=_.
join in a multilateral declaration (since.the one planned would ...-
include the Cesmunists) but it is meking a declaration of its’ ”_
