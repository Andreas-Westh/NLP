FOR THE SECRETARY FROM THE UNDERSECRETARY. eS
‘ ia:
The outlines of ere at controlonow clearly emerge. 4
, Composition will probably be Poland, India, and Canada or Belgium Oi
The French prefer Belgium and so do I. Both Poland and Canada re
or Belgium will have veto on important questions. Commission G
will have full freedom of movement in demilitarized zones which 7 >’
= will separate forces at each stage of regrouping and in all a=
er é frontier,and seacoast areas. . \
(!6 ~] Taking everything into consideration, .I strongly feel this is 2
. satisfactory and much better than we were able to obtain in =
Korea. French feel, and Eden and I agree, that with such Ry
-composition built-in veto will work to'our advantage. This :
setup is best French or anybody else could get, and I feel it Sek
is within spirit of point /. (
