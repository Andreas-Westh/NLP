CONCLUSTON

I recommend that the Department of Defense urge that negotiations for
agreements to be initiated at the earliest time to achieve the foregoing objectives
and that upon reaching an understanding with France and the Associated States,

a full-scale U.S. training mission be established with the Associated States
forces to achieve an effective training base by Spring of 1956. That the French
overwhelm the enemy in the interim is a vital concurrent requirement, and,
again, this objective mist be achieved by governmental agreement, with the

U.S. insisting that the French Government establish military victory as a
primary objective and so instruct the field commander, who may then be

relieved of his anxieties regarding casualties and indifferent political

and moral support from France.

In conclusion, I reaffirm my opinion that victory in Indochina is an

international rather than a local matter, and essentially political as well
as military.
