â‚¬. Opportunities for employment of large tactical air forces and seagoing
naval and amphibious forces are limited.

d. Stratesic targets are limited. Terrain and enemy skill in camouflage
reduce number of tactical targets.

e. A shortage of trained air personnel exists, with limited prospects for
augmentation from metropolitan France resources,

f. Commercial resources satisfy a considerable portion of naval and air
logistical requirements.

g Airfield construction limits composition of air traffic to light and
medium transports and propeller-driven fighters and bombers. The balance of
forces is considered adequate, although recently the French Air Force, motivated
by unanticipated operational requirements in Laos and Dien Bien Phu, has requested
additional B-26 light bombers, an additional c-7 transport squadron, and the loan
of U.S. C-119 heavy transports and maintenance personnel. Civilian CAT pilots are
presently on contract to the French Air Force for logistical missions. The Army
likewise has requested increased air strength in the form of helicopter companies
and liaison aircraft.
