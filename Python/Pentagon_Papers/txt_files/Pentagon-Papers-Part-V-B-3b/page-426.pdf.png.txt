/.9- 41, July 4, 3 p.m.,; from Paris

We have Ge strong cat which so far we have apparently not
cared to use. ee ts ve can trade willingness to give full
| diplomatic support to French in their effort to_séll setttement
to Vietnam in return for a settlement that we car support.
The indication which French now have that no matter what—the
settlement may be, we cannot be counted upon for support with ,
‘Vietnam obviously greatly weakens our influence with French.

In conclusion if we base our actions solely on the attempt to
get the best possible settlement I feel that we should (1)
maintain our delegation at Geneva, (2) have you or the Under
Secretary return to head the delegation when the other Foreign
Ministers return, (3) tell the French at once that we will
support them in selling settlement to Vietnam provided that
settlement is satisfactory to us, (4) maintain close contact
with and pressure on Eden so he sticks to 7 points US-UK
agreement. :

I fully realize that domestic political considerations must
-also be taken into account, but I am not in a posi,tion to
evaluate them so I have confined these thoughts to a description
of the best method available to US to influence the final
settlement at Geneva in the direction we desire.
