8. In stating certain implementing actions to the current
military posture of the United States, the Joint Chiefs of
Staff stated inter alia:

"Certain other countries such as Indochina, to which
the United States has no specific commitment, are of such
importance to the United States that an attack on them
probably would compel the United States to react with
military force either locally at the point of attack or
generally against the military power of the aggressor."

It is considered that the rest of the Southeast Asian countries
are included in the above category. ;

9. In view of the above, the United States should adopt
the concept of offensive actions against the "military power
of the aggressor," in this instance Communist China, rather
than the concept of "reaction locally at the point of attack,"
which is the thesis of the action outlined in paragraphs 5
and 6 above.

10. The force requirements and the logistic support for
the operations envisaged in paragraph 9 above are being con-
sidered but have not been fully developed. However, it is
felt that adoption of this concept would provide a more
acceptable return for the manpower and resources expended
than would be the case in the concept of a static defense.

11. Upon the decision to implement either one or the other
of these courses of action, it would be necessary to insure
the degree of mobilization required to take care of the in-
ereased possibility of a general war.
