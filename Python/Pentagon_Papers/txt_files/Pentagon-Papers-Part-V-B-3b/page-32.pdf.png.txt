(3) Increase monetary value of FY 54 MDA Programs for
Indochina, as may be necessary and feasible to provide
additional materiel and/or training requested by Chief,
MAAG, Indochina.

(4) Undertake the implementation of these instructions
through such organizations and by such procedures as are
considered necessary to insure prompt and effective re-
sponse to valid requests for assistance..

Discussion: To date, restrictive criteria and proce-
dures have seriously handicapped the administration of
MDAP assistance in the support of the effort in Indochina.
MDAP assistance is normally used to support a training
and re-equipment program. In Indochina, however, such
equipment is being used to support an active campaign.
The purpose of the above is to free the Services of all
restrictive criteria other than final legal limitation
of available funds in order that prompt and effective
response may be achieved in meeting all valid requests
received from Chief, MAAG, Indochina.

h. Give consideration to interim revision of French NATO
commitments in Europe in order to allow provision of addi-
tional French air personnel to Indochina.

Discussion: Shortage of air personnel has been one
major factor in prolonging the war. A reappraisal of
French NATO commitments should be considered with a view
toward releasing additional French air personnel for
Indochina.

i. Insure that personnel assigned to MAAG, Indochina, are
qualified to advise the French Union forces on U.S. tactics
and techniques.

Discussion: This would provide the benefit of U.S.
battle experience for use in Indochina.

j- Consideration should be given at Governmental level
to the proposition of declarations as follows:

(1) By France: A declaration of intention to prosecute
the war in Indochina to a successful conclusion and looking
toward the more complete independence of the Associated
States of Indochina.
