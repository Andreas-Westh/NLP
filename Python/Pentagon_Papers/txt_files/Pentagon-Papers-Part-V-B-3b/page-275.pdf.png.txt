delivered in Indochina by the US will be recovered or
destroyed to the maximum practicable extent.

for guidance and appropriate action, and to the Secretary of State and
the Director, Foreign Operations Administration for information.

It is requested that special security precautions be
observed in the handling of the above statement on policy and that access
to it be very strictly limited on an absolute need-to-know basis,

Signed: JAMES S. LAY, Jr.
