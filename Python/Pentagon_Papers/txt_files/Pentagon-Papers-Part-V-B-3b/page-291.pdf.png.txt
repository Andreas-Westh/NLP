Re DEPLEL 4130

I have been much eoncerned about EDC situation for some time.
Two things are perfectly clear,

1. That as long as present state of acute crisis exists re-
garding Indochina there is no hope of a successful debate on
EDC. The singleminded effort for a period of at least two
weeks of all pro-EDC elements in government will be necessary
in order to have chance of ratification of EDC by French
Parliament.

2. <Any attempt to force EDC to a vote before Indochina crisis
has been further clarified would lead to indefinite postpone- )
ment or defeat of EDC. â€™

While pro-ECD members of French Government originally saw no
connection between EDC and Geneva, the fall of Dien Bien Phu

and present military crisis in Indochina has drastically changed
situation. EDC is for the moment inextricably intertwined with !
both Geneva and Franco-US negotiations regarding united action |
in Indochina. While there is no direct logical connection be-
tween the two, the way in which we handle present Indochina
negotiations with French is bound to have great effect on our
friends in French Government who are supporting EDC. The two
key elements in this situation are (1) the finding of a so-
lution to the clarification of: the independence of Associated
States that will not require France to publicly proclaim right
of withdrawal from French union and (2) the question of Marines
for Indochina as raised by Schumann in EMBTEL 4416. Unless we
can satisfy this request for Marines, I am very much afraid
that the emotional reaction here will be such that there will
be no hope of EDC ratification at least for months to come.

Indeed, if we
