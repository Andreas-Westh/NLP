THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF

27 April 1954

MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE

Subject: French Request for Additional Aid
References: a. NIACT 4085
b. SECTO 14

1. The Joint Chiefs of Staff lack verified logistical infor-
mation, including the comments of the Chief, MAAG, Indochina in
regard to feasibility of the aid requested by the French. This
information has been requested as soon as possible.

2. Pending receipt of such data and comments from Chief,
MAAG, Indochina, which may materially alter the observations
on feasibility which follow, the comments of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff on the French request are indicated below:

a. From the viewpoint of military effectiveness the pro-

posal offers little insofar as relief of Dien Bien Phu is
concerned,

b. It would appear that the psychological aspect could

be satisfied by confining the operation to one field only-—-
that at Seno.

c. The Seno airfield appears also to be the only one in
which rehabilitation and preparation are feasible within any-
thing like the timing proposed. Preparation of the two other
fields included in the French request would require from 2 to

4 weeks and greatly increased supply, logistic and construc
tion effort.

d. It should be pointed out that the proposal is by no
means a “one shot" affair but represents a continuing logis-
tic supply requirement of no small proportions with a corre—
sponding reduction of the airlift capabilities of CINCFE.
