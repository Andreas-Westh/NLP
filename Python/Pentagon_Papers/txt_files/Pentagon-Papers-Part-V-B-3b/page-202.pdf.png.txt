Dear Alex:

This Department is becoming increasingly concerned regarding
the lack of a U.S. position in preparation for the Indochina phase
of the Conference to be held at Geneva. I fully appreciate the dif-
ficulties which, up until this time, have made it very difficult to
draft a position on Indochina. However, in- view of the short time
remaining until the Conference convenes at Geneva, it is essential
that consideration be given to the U.S. position.

It appears to me that ample guidance is available to provide the
basis for an initial draft of a U.S. Government position on Indochina
for Geneva. NSC 5405 as well as reports of the Special Committee set
forth, in positive terms, U.S. policy with respect to Indochina and
Southeast Asia. At the meetings of the Indochina Working Group the
need for a U.S. position on Indochina has been discussed at consider-
able length, but to date no progress has been made. In order to
initiate action on a draft position, the Defense representatives at
the working level submitted an outline of views to the State members
of the Indochina Working Group. A copy of this paper is attached for
your information.

In view of the foregoing I strongly recommend that immediate
action be taken to draft a U.S. position paper on Indochina for the
Conference at Geneva. I would be glad to discuss this matter further
at your convenience or at a meeting of the Assistant Secretaries.

Sincerely yours,

For the Assistant Secretary of Defense (ISA):
