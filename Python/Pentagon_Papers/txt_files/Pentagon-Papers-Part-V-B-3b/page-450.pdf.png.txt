| I delivered Secretary’ S$ message Department telegram le/ to - &
Mendes <in Geneva after lunch Sunday. At same time, I gave + =e
i cyemty Pei personal message contained in first paragraph Department’ a
Ie L.S'P TAs) telegram 128. In view Eden's absence (SECTO 585), I did not an
(repeat not) see him. Johnson will deliver message to Eden _ a:
tomorrow, if Aldrich has not (repeat not) already done so. ** Gi
7 Mendes was very touched by personal message in Be a
telegram 128 and twice asked me to be sure and thank Secretary
on his behalf for this thought.
Regarding Department telegram 127, Mendes expressed extreme
disappointment and gave concern at United States decision
not (repeat not) to be represented at Ministerial level. He
divided his remarks into two categories, first, the effect of
our decision on Conference itself, and second, the overall] -
effect of our decision on world affairs. —-
Regarding first category, Mendes stated that our absence made =!
French bargeining position far weaker. He stated that if (23
Secretary was present, France would not (repeat not) ac cpt ~° 4
anything at Conference that was unacceptable to United wtates. ._
As he put it in his own words, presence of Secretary would ‘ia
give United States in effect a veto power on decisions of ee
Conference. He felt it particularly important that we have nes
someone at Geneva who could take strong personal position with 7%

; Molotov, if and when necessary, and without having to refer to* ‘--

s Washington for instructions. Mendes also feels that United S

States “absence at Ministerial level will lead Communists to “" =

jncrease their pressure and be more demanding in order to = rie

despen the obvious rift between the Western powers. He said - =:
