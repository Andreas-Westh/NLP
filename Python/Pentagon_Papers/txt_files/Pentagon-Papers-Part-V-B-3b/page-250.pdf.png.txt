wrangle characterized by steadfast Communist eenerne to an 7
inflexible position on important issues and by repeated sub-
‘
stantive concessions by the French. Moreover, experience in
Korea indicates that regardless of the military and adminis-~ ,
trative controls which might be embodied in the armistice con-
ventions, it 1s certain that the Communists would flagrantly
evace, ‘circunvent, and violate the agreements to suit their
ultimate purpose of subjugating all of Indochina. Even though ,
the Communists should agree to international control machinery,
Communist practices would render it impotent, es in the case of

the. Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in Korea.

4, Based on past performance, it is doubtful that the Com-
RISER would enter into a preliminary agreement to refrain
from new military operations during the course of armistice
negotiations. On the contrary, it is more Likely that they
would intensify military operations during negotiations! in order
‘to enhance their negotiating position, whereas the French would
7 o

be under strong compulsion to avoid casualties during the

negotiating period.
