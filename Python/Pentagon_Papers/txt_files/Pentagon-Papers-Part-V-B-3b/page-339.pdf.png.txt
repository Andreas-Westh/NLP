Second, I think it preferable that’ the word "justified" be
used in place of the word "authorized" in both paragraphs 3 and 4
of the draft Joint Resolution. The Joint Resolution of Congress
approving President Wilson's action at the time of the Tampico in-
cident designedly employed the word "justified" in order to avoid
the implication that Congress was exercising the power which it
alone has to declare war. 2/ Moreover, I have taken the position
internally within the Department of Defense that, as a matter of
constitutional law, the President has authority to use the armed
forces to repel aggression abroad without specific approval from
the Congress where the circumstances of the situation require it.
If this draft“Joint Resolution is passed in its present form it
will be a precedent for the proposition that the President must
under the Constitution have an authorization from the Congress be-
fore he can use the armed forces to repel aggression abroad in cases
of this sort in the future where the time element may be even more
critical than in the present case.

I think the first of these two points is worth mentioning. I
think the second is worth pressing for.

(Signed)

Wilber M. Brucker
General Counsel
