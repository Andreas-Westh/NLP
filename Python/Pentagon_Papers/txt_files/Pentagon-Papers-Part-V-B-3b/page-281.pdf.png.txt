I SAW KANIEL AND SCHUMANN THIS EVENING REGARDING DEPTEL Ct

4§23. BEFORE DISCUSSION STARTED ON REFTEL, LANIEL MADE A oO

NUMBER OF OBSERVATIONS AND ASKED TWO ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS. se

HE SAID THAT HE WAS SENDING GENERAL ELY TO INDOCHINA IMMED- O
TATELY. HE WILL LEAVE ON SATURDAY OR SUNDAY AND WILL STAY O

IN INDOCHINA ONLY TWO TO FOUR DAYS. PURPOSE OF HIS VISIT IS meg

TO CHECK UP ON MILITARY SITUATION ON THE SPOT AND ON PHYSICAL Gy
AND MENTAL CONDITION OF GENERAL NAVARRE. BECAUSE OF ELY'S ,
PROSPECTIVE ABSENCE FROM PARIS, LANIEL SUGGESTED THAT GENERAL =u

-« TRAPNELL, OR WHOEVER ELSE WE PLAN TO SEND TO PARIS IN ANSWER K
, TO LANIEL’S REQUEST FOR AMERICAN MILITARY ADVICE, ARRIVE CG
APPROXIMATELY THURSDAY OF NEXT WEEK. GENERAL ELY WILL UNDER- mH

_ TAKE SUCH RE-GROUPING OF FRENCH FORCES AND SHORTENING OF Aci
LINES AS MAY BE NECESSARY. THIS WILL PROBABLY INCLUDE WITH~
DRAWAL OF PORTION, AND MAYBE LARGE PORTION, OF THE FRENCH
FORCES NOW IN LAO FINAL DECISIONS, HOWEVER, WILL ONLY BE
TAKEN UPON been OF GENERAL ELY TO PARIS.

LANIEL THEN POSED FOLLOWING TWO QUESTIONS: ONE, COULD THE
UNITED STATES FIND A WAY TO GUARANTEE THE BORDERS AND THE
INDEPENDENCE OF LAOS AND CAMBODIA. IF SUCH A GUARANTEE COULD
BE MADE, HE FELT IT WOULD BE OF GREAT HELP AFTER THE FRENCH
FORCES HAD BEEN WITHDRAWN. LANIEL'S SECOND QUESTION DEALT
WITH ACTION UNITED STATES WILL TAKE IN THE CASE OF INTERVENTION
BY MIG 15°S AIRCRAFT. HE SAID THAT FOR HIS OWN PROTECTION a
BOAR: HERE HE WOULD LIKE DEFINITE foeu Aer s WRITTEN IY POSSIBLE, a
j THAT U.S. AVIATION WOULD COME INSTANTLY TO THE HELP OF FRENCH ~
dae a FORCES IN DELTA IF THEY WERE ATTACKED BY MIG*S. HE SAID THAT
; We . HE WOULD HAVE NO DEFENSE BEFORE PARLIAMENT OR FRENCH PUBLIC
Bas - OPINION IF HE WAS NOT ABLE TO OBTAIN SOME SUCH ASSURANCE AS |
~ THERE WERE NO ADEQUATE ANTI-AIRCRAFT DEFENSES IN THE DELTAY
