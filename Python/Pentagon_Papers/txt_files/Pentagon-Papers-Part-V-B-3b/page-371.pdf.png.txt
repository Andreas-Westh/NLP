Paris 4448 is exceedingly good--in fact almost too good. as)
Although there are one or two points to which we might take e
exception from purely military aspect, I desire to confine oO.
my comment to political connotations of Valluy's statement. OQ:
’ I have impression that under instructions he made this very Se
concise evaluation less with military considerations in mind G):
than with political objectives in view. I think that Valluy 1:
was looking as much at the French: Parliament as he was at the =
Tonkin delta when he made his speech. General Hly has twice ‘oN
in my .presence stated that his keenest desire is for United_ Gi
States to enter this war. Only yesterday his Chief of Steff, WN
Colonel Brohan, repeated this comment. My belief is that ,
purpose of Valluy_statement was elther to bring us and, if
possible, other rive powers into. conflict here or, failing
that, to prepare excuse before history’ for an impending armistice
which French would then request. of Viet Minh.
