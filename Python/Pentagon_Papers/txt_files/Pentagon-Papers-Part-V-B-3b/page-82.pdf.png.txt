4. Therefore, the Joint Chiefs of Staff feel that it
is more essential than ever, in the interests of the United
States, that this basic issue of authority commensurate
with responsibility be satisfactorily resolved in advance
on a governmental level and in a manner acceptable to the
United States.

5. Inasmuch as this basic matter requires reconsidera-
tion, we believe that the question of the rank proposed for
Lieutenant General O'Daniel, USA, as Chief, MAAG, Indochina,
should be reconsidered. The Joint Chiefs of Staff hold it
to be distinctly detrimental to the prestige of the United
States Military Services in general,.and to the United States
Army in particular to demote a distinguished senior United
States Army officer already well and widely known in that
region, The repercussions of such action in the Orient are
well known.

6. In light of the above, the Joint Chiefs of Staff
recommend that:

a. The basic issue of increased responsibility of
MAAG, Indochina, with respect to training be satisfac~
torily resolved on a governmental level, and in a man-
ner acceptable to the United States.

b. The despatch of General O'Daniel to Indochina,
and his demotion both be held in abeyance until the
training issue is satisfactorily settled.

For the Joint Chiefs of Staff:

ARTHUR RADFORD,
Chairman,
Joint Chiefs of Staff.
