PARTS FOR AMBASSADOR

LIMIT DISTRIBUTION.

6. ELY REPEATED HIS BELIEF THAT PAST SUPPORT FOR DIEM HAD

NOT BEEN AN ERROR. He SAID THAT WE MUST NOW ENVISAGE CHANGING
PRIME MINISTER BUT NOT REPEAT NOT POLICY. THIS, HE SAID,
CORRESPONDS TO WISHES OF VIETNAMESE PEOPLE. I ASKED ELY

HOW HE COULD PROVE SUCH IS WILL OF VIETNAMESE PEOPLE IN ABSENCE
OF ANY ASSEMBLY. STATEMENT CAN ONLY REPRESENT ELY'S ESTIMATE,
HE REPLIED IT IS OBVIOUS THAT PEOPLE WISH TO BE RID OF DIEM.

I REPLIED DIEM COULD CHALLENGE STATEMENT AND, IN ANY CASE,

NO ONE WAS IN POSITION TO PROVE VIETNAMESE PEOPLE WISHED

TO BE RID OF DIEM, ELY SAID PRESENT CRISIS ITSELF WAS
EVIDENCE, I REPLIED THAT CRISIS HAD BEEN CAUSED BY SECT
MINORITY LOOKING AFTER OWN SELFISH INTERESTS. SAME GOVERNMENTAL
PROGRAM UNDER ANOTHER PRIME MINISTER WOULD INEVITABLY HAVE

LED TO OPPOSITION FROM SECTS. ELY SAID THAT IF SUCH OTHER
PRIME MINISTER HAD BEEN SIMILAR TO DIEM HE WOULD AGREE,

BUT DIEM HAD HANDLED SITUATION VERY BADLY, AND EVEN HIS OWN
RELATIVES, DO AND THOAT, NO LONGER BELIEVED IN HIM.

7. I TOLD ELY HE AND I WERE FOREIGNERS HERE AND EVEN BAO

DAT WAS TO SOME EXTENT FOREIGN, NONE OF US COULD SAY WHETHER
VIETNAMESE PEOPLE WERE UNITED AS TO CHOICE OF ANY SUCCESSOR
TO DIEM. WITHOUT PARLIAMENT, IT CANNOT BE PROVED TO U.S.
PUBLIC AND PRESS OPINION THAT DIEM IS NO LONGER WANTED,

IF DIEM WAS REMOVED IN ABSENCE OF SOME REPRESENTATIVE BODY,

I COULD NOT PREDICT U.S. CONGRESSIONAL REACTION. THEREFORE,

Terai
