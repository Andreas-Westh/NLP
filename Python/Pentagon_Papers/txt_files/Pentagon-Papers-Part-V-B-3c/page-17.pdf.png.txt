Vietnam (DRV), though confronted by serious economic
problems, will consolidate its control north of the
17th parallel. The DRV army has increased in strength
but will probably not atteck Laos before mid-1956.

' Tactics are likely to include activation of guerrille
units in South Vietnam and their reinforcement by
infiltration from the North. NIE 63.1-55, 19 July 1955..... 993

261. The consequences of selected U.S. courses of action
are estimated in the event of Viet Minh aggression
against South Vietnam. While overt aggression is

unlikely, U.S. efforts at undertaking other steps
to convince the Viet Minh that aggression will be
met with interwention are expected to render overt
aggression even less likely. Failure to intervene
however, could signel.an expanded Communist Chinese
effort in Asia. SHIE 63.1-4-55, 13 September 1955.......... 297
