During the meeting I examined the piece of paper from
which Stassen was reading. It was a single sheet-which I
had never seen before and on it was indicated that certain
Getails had been received from Collins with respect to.his
106 million dollar calculation for the FEC during calendar
i955, I have never seen such details and do not know whether
they have been made available to my office, Furthermore,
the typewritten portion of such sheet stated that no budget
support would be granted to supplies, equipment, etc. not
received in Indochina without specifying any limiting date.
the idea of a limiting date in this respect of Pv euer 31,
1955 was inserted in pencil, ‘

After the meeting, I complained to Stassen about our
lack of notice of, the 3:00 P.M, meeting today. He replied
that he personally had not received any longer notice than
I had and that the entire commitment as phrased was based
on the Dulles desire to communicate as promptly as possible
to the French that their expectations of receiving budget
support in the amount of $300 million for calendar year 1955
were without foundation and that the 100 million dollar
commitment as made was based on the recommendation from
General Collins, I replied that I was fully aware that
Secretary Dulles did not want to give the French a valid
excuse for pulling out of Indochina completely and leaving .
the problem in our hands without the French available to bear
any responsibility, but that Defense had not agreed, insofar
as i knew, to the original position paper on this subject ~
and had accepted the Collins recommendation of $100 million
subject to an opportunity to check the basis of his calcula-
tions, I further explained that I had told the State Depart~
ment (I believe it was Livingston Merchant, but it might
have been Nolting) during the Mendes-—France and Dulles talks
that I believed we should express any statements made about-
100 miilion dollars for the FEC as a maximum and give the
impression that it might be reduced, Such was not done by

' Stassen and apparently my expression of-opinion had REVeX
been communicated to him,

{ further made the point that Defense. had a substantial
interest in these matters, that Defense approval should be
oo ee in advance of any discussions with the French or at

ast Defense be given an opportunity to express its opinion

and that any. meeting scheduled should only be after adequate
