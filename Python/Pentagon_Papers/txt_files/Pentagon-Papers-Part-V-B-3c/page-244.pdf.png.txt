SUCH NOTIFICATION, Hi WILL CALL ON ME TO FIND OUT WHAT
INFORMATION I HAVE AND PERHAPS TO ASK FOR ADVICE, I WOULD
PROPOSE REPLYING THAT I HAD BEEN NOTIFIED BY MY GOVERNMENT
OF DECISION OF BAO DAT, AND WOULD SEEK TO PERSUADE DIEM TO .
REMAIN IN OFFICE UNTIL HIS SUCCESSOR COULD TAKE OVER.

WE SHOULD BE WILLING TO ASSIST HIM IN PREPARING A STATEMENT
WHICH HE MIGHT ISSUE AS INDICATED IN PARAGRAPH 2A ABOVE,

4, REACH AGREEMENT BETWEEN U.S., FRANCE, AND NEW PRESIDENT
ON PROGRAM FOR SOLUTION OF SECT POLITICAL AND MILITARY
PROBLEMS. IT IS BELIEVED THAT AN AGREEMENT WOULD HAVE TO

BE REACHED BETWEEN ELY, THE NEW PRESIDENT, AND MYSERF, ON

A PROGRAM FOR SOLUTION OF THE POLITICAL AND MILITARY PROBLEMS
OF THE SECTS. â€˜THIS WOULD REQUIRE A PRIOR AGREEMENT BETWEEN
FRENCH AND U.S. GOVERNMENTS ALONG THE LINES OF OUR PROPOUALS
CONTAINED IN EMBASSY TELEGRAM 4373. THESE PROPOSALS ARE
BEING ACTIVELY STUDIED NOW BY GENERAL ELY'S STAFF. WE
EXPECT TO COME TO AGREEMENT HERE WITHIN 48 HOURS. APPROVAL
WILL STILL BE REQUIRED FROM WASHINGTON, PARTICULARLY AS TO
ADDED COSTS WHICH ARE INVOLVED IN THE INDUCTION OF MORE SECT
PERSONNEL THAN ORIGINALLY COUNTEMPLATED, SEVERANCE PAY FOR
SECT PERSONNEL TO BE DEMOBILIZED, AND LARGER AVERAGE STRENGTH
OF ARMED FORCES FOR FY 1955, CAUSED BY SLOW-DOWN IN DISCHARGE
OF VIETNAMESE ARMY PERSONNEL AS A RESULT OF PRESENT SECT
CRISIS. ,

5. OBTAIN AGREEMENT OF SECTS TO PROPOSED SOLUTION OF THEIR
PROBLEMS .

A. NEXT STEP WOULD PROBABLY BE FOR NEW PRESIDENT TO MEET
WITH LEADERS OF SECTS AND OBTAIN THEIR AGREEMENT TO SOLUTION
ARRIVED AT UNDER PARAGRAPH 4 ABOVE. HE WOULD HAVE TO MAKE
CLEAR TO SECTS THAT THIS WAS BEST PROGRAM THEY COULD POSSIBLY
OBTAIN AND THAT IT WAS ONLY WAY TO CONTINUE AMERICAN AND
FRENCH FINANCIAL AND MORAL SUPPORT, WITHOUT WHICH THE COUNTRY
COULD NOT POSSIBLY BE SAVED FROM VIET MINH AND COMMUNISM
WHICH SECTS PROFESS TO DETEST,

B, iT IS OUR THOUGHT THAT SECTS WOULD NOT BE INVITED -TO
PARTICIPATE IN CABINET, EXCEPT FOR POSSIBLY ONE OR TWO MEN,
WHO MIGHT BE CHOSEN BECAUSE OF THEIR ABILITY RATHER THAN AS

REPRESENTATIVES
