HOW TO DEAL WITH FORTHCOMING ELECTIONS, DIVISION OF COUNTRY
HAD GIVEN SOUTH VIETNAM DISADVANTAGE IN COMPETING WITH NORTH
BUT WHAT SOUTH LACKED IN AREA AND POPULATION WAS COUNTER-
BALANCED BY HER ECONOMIC SUPERIORITY, FRANCE BELIEVED THAT
SOUTH COULD WIN OVER NORTH IN ELECTIONS IF SHE COULD PRESENT
MORE ATTRACTIVE REGIME TO PEOPLE, THIS COULD BE DONE ONLY
WITH NATIONALIST, STABLE AND BROADLY BASED GOVT. TIME WAS OF
ESSENCE FOR DISCUSSIONS PRIOR TO ELECTIONS WHICH WOULD OPEN
NEXT JULY AND ELECTIONS THEMSELVES IN JULY 1956. â€˜THERE WAS NO
AMBIGUITY IN FRENCH POLICY BETWEEN NORTH AND SOUTH VIETNAM.
PRESENCE OF FRANCE IN NORTH COULD NOT BE ERASED BY STROKE OF
PEN, IT IS FRENCH DUTY TO PROTECT HER CULTURAL AND ECONOMIC
PRESENCE THERE. SATINTENY MISSION IS DESIGNED FOR ONLY THAT
PURPOSE, FRANCE HAD GIVEN UP THOUGHTS OF MIXED COMPANIES AS
RESULT OUR OBJECTIONS AND HAD NOW SURRENDERED COAL MINES.
SAINTENY MISSION WOULD BE MAITNTATNED ON ITS PRESENT TERMS.

TT WOULD BE NEITHER ENLARGED NOR CHANGED.

LAFOREST CONTINUED TO SAY THAT FRANCE HAD LOYALLY SUPPORTED
GOVT OF DIEM FROM BEGINNING. ANY ALLEGATION TO CONTRARY IS
UNTRUE. FRENCH CONSTANTLY TRIED TO REENFORCE DIEM GOVT.
FRANCE REACHED AGREEMENT WITH US LAST DECEMBER TO PERSUADE

"OR COMPEL" DIEM TO ENLARGE GOVT. IT WAS AGREED TO GIVE HIM
UNEIL JANUARY AT WHICH TIME, IF HE HAD FATLED, WE WOULD LOOK
INTO MATTER OF ALTERNATE DISCREETLY. THIS WAS NOT DONE.

LAST MARCH PRESENT GOVT BROKE INTO OPEN CONFLICT WITH SECTS.
UNITED FRONT OF SECTS WAS FORMED AGAINST DIEM, BOTH DECEMBER
AGREEMENT AND COMMON SENSE TOLD US AT THAT TIME THAT SOMETHING
TO BE DONE TO AVOID CIVIL WAR, FRANCE WARNED THAT ARMED
CONFLICT - FIRST CIVIL WAR, THEN GUERRILLA WARFARE, THEN
TERRORISM - WOULD RESULT IF WE FATLED TO TAKE ACTION. FRANCE
HAS ALWAYS DESIRED PEACEFUL SOLUTION. FOR THIS REASON JOINT
ELY-COLLINGS APPROACH WAS TRIED, IT WAS HOPED THEY WOULD
ARRIVE AT JOINT PLAN FOR SOLUTION. WASHINGTON APPEARED FIRST
TO WELCOME THIS CONCEPE THEN CHANGED ITS MIND. COLLINS LEFT
SAIGON WHEN CIVIL WAR WAS ABOUT TO BREAK OUT. UNTENABLE TRUCES
WERE DECLARED. WHEN THEY WERE ABOUT TO EXPIRE BAO DAI SUB-
MITTED HIS OWN PLAN ON APRIL 19 IN ORDER TO TRY TO RECONCILE US

AND FRENCH
