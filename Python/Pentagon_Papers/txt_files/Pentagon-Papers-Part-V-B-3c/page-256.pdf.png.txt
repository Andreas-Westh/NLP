PRIORITY ~

DIEM'S FAULTY HANDLING OF THE PROBLEM HAS NOW RESULTED IN

THE BINH XUYEN BECOMING A MAJOR FORCE, THE HANDLING OF WhiCH
IS OUT OF HAND, RATHER THAN A MINOR ONS WHICH COULD HAVE BEEN
USED IN THE COMMON EFFORT IF DIEM HAD NOT BUNGLED MATTERS.

BAO DAT NOW BELIEVES THAT THE BINH XUYEN MUST GO EVENTUALLY
BUT THAT THERE IS NO POSSIBLE MEANS OF REMOVING THEM FROM THE
SCENE UNDER THE STRESS OF THE PRESENT CRISTS BY SIMPLY ISSUING
A DECREE TO THAT EFFECT. THE DECREE WOULD BE IGNORED AND BAO
DAT'S AUTHORITY LOST. DIEM HAD BEGGED FOR. FULL POWERS AND

HAD TOLD BAO DAT THAT IT WAS WHAT THE UNITED STATES WANTED
HIM TO HAVE. BAO DAT HAD GRANTED THEM AGAINST HIS ADVISORS.
NOW DIEM IS INCAPABLE OF GOVERNING EVEN WITH THESE POWERS AND
WISHES BAO DAI TO DO SO FOR HIM BY DECREE, IF BAO DAI WERE

TO DO SO, HE WOULD BE EXPENDING HIS AUTHORITY FOR A CAUSE
WHICH IS ALREADY LOST, WHICH HE IS UNWILLING TO DO. DIEM HAS
NOL THE MILITARY OR POLITICAL STRENGTH TO CARRY OUT HIS

ORDERS BY FORCE, AND IF HE ATTEMPTS TO SUPPRESS THE BINH
XUYEN IN THAT MANNER, IT WILL LEAD TO CIVIL WAR WHICH WOULD
IN BAO DAL'S OPINION RESULT IN FREE VIETNAM PASSING UNDER
VIET MINH CONTROL IN SHORT ORDER. EVEN IF IT WERE POSSIBLE

TO BACK THE GOVERNMENT TO THE EXTENT OF FORCING THE BINH XUYEN
OUT OF THE SATGON POLICE (PRESUMABLY WITH OUTSIDE AID FROM

THE FRENCH OR THE UNITED STATES), IT WOULD RESULT IN DIEM
BECOMING "EMPEROR OF SAIGON" AND WITH THE REST OF THE COUNTRY
UNDER CONTROL OF LOCAL SECT TROOPS AND, EVENTUALLY, OF THE
VIET MINH. DE QUOTED BAO DAT'S SOURCES IN SAIGON AS REPORTING
DIEM'S STRENGTH AS A "MOCKERY",

AFTER THIS PROLONGED EXPOSE, WE ASKED DE WHAT BAO DAT THOUGHT
SHOULD BE DONE. HE REPLIED THAT THE UNTTED STATES GOVERN-
MENT SHOULD ARRIVE AT AN IMMEDIATE AGREEMENT WITH THE FRENCH
TO CREATE SOME FORM OF GOVERNING BODY WHICH COULD TAKE OVER
PERMANENT ie 910 THE EXECUTIVE
