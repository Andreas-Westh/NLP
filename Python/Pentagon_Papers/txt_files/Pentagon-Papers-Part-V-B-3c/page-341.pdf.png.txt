The DRV. probably still believes that it

tions with control of all Vietnam. It will
attempt to appear reasonable in any ne-
gotiations concerning procedures for elec-
tions. While the Communists almost
certainly would not agree to complex and
elaborate safeou uards and guarantees,
they probably would agree to some form

-of “neutral” (but not UN) suvervision.

They would ‘probably estimate that such
election controls would work to their ad-
vantage in the South and, as manipu-
lated, would not adversely affect their
position in the North. (Paras. 44-45)

6. In the meantime, the DRV will con-
tinue its efforts, through subversion, in-
timidation, and propaganda, to weaken
the Diem government, and to bring to
power in the South men prepared to ac-
cept a coalition with the DRV. (Para.
46)

7. The Communists in thelr propaganda
have revealed sensitivity to the implica-
tion of the Manila Pact which incorpo-
rated Vietnam, Cambodia, and Lacs in its
area of protection. We believe that con-
cern for Western, and particularly US re
actions, together with general donaiders-|
tions arising from over-all Bloc policy,
will prevent the DRV from openly in-|
vading the South during the period of"
this estimate. Similarly, the resumption

of widespread guerrilla activities appears _
