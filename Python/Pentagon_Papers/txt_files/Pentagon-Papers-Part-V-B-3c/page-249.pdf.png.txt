DEPARTMENT TELEGRAMS 4411 ana 41a,

2. OWING HIS SPECIAL SENSE OF MISSION, DIEM WILL PROBABLY
PUL UP WHATEVER RESISTANCE HE CAN TO BEING REMOVED, BUT I
DOUBT HE WILL FIND SUBSTANTIAL SUPPORT IN ANY QUARTER, IN
END HE WILL PROBABLY RETIRE IN OUTRAGE FROM SCENE AND: VOICE
HIS PROTESTS AGAINST BAO DAT, FRANCE AND U.S. IN SOME KIND
OF "WHITE PAPER", te
A. CERTAIN VIETNAMESE NATIONALISTS WOULD SEIZE ON DIEM'S
REMOVAL TO FAN ANTI-FRENCH SENTIMENT, BUT I DO NOT BELIEVE
- DIEM'S REMOVAL WOULD RESULT IN POPULAR VIOLENCE AGAINST
FRENCH EXCEPT POSSIBLY SPORADIC INDIVIDUAL INCIDENTS.

B, I BELIEVE DIEM WOULD ULTIMATELY ACCEPT REMOVAL AS STATED
PARAGRAPH 2 ABOVE, I THINK HE IS TRUE PATRIOT AND WOULD NOT
TRY SABOTAGE CONSTRUCTIVE PROGRAM OF NEW GOVERNMENT. I DO
NOT AGREE THAT HE STILL HAS "CONSIDERABLE POWER" EXCEPT
SUPPORT OF FRANCE AND U.S. JI HAVE TRIED TO CONVEY TO
DEPARTMENT HOW SLENDER BASIS OF DIEM'S PRESENT SUPPORT NOW IS.
IF FRENCH AND U.S. SUPPORT IS WITHDRAWN, DIEM WILL BE HARD
PRESSED TO MUSTER ANY ALLIES, AND FEW IF ANY OF THESE ARE
LIKELY TO RESORT TO VIOLENCE IN HIS SUPPORT.

3. NATIONAL ARMY LOYALTY, WHICH DIEM DOES NOT FULLY
COMMAND, IS NOT COMPLETELY TRANSFERRABLE TO ANY INDIVIDUAL.
I BELIEVE, HOWEVER, ARMY LOYALTY COULD BE SECURED BY NEW
GOVERNMENT MORE BROADLY BASED, NOT RIVEN BY POLITICAL
JEALOUSIES AND CRISES LIKE DIEM REGIME, AND FULLY BACKED BY
FRANCE AND U.S. HOWEVER, THERE MAY BE INDIVIDUAL BATTALION
COMMANDERS IN CENTER VIET NAM WHO MIGHT LEAD GROUPS OFâ€™ MEN

eas, TO DEFECT.
