S, In view of the importance of Vietnam to 11 of southeast
Asia, I an cofvinced that the United States shovld extend the.
funds, materiel, and effort, required to strengthen the country
and help it retain its independence, I cannot guarantee that
Vietnam will remein free, even with ovr aid. But I know that
without our aid Victnan will surely be lost to Communism. If
the chances of suceess are difficult to calevlate, the results
of a withdraval of American aid are only too certain, not only
in Vietnam but turcugrout Southeast Asia. Such 4 withdraywel would
hasten the rate of Communist advances in the Mar bast as a whole
and could result in the loss of Southeast Asia to Communism. in
my opinion, the chance of success is not only worth the gamble;
we cannot efford to let free Vietnam go by default.
