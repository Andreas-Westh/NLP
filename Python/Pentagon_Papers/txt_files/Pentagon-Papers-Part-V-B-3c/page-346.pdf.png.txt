flict which might embroil them in general war.
In any event, the Europeans would not neces-
sarily conclude that the US would fail to ‘resist
Communist aggression in Western Europe.

.- Middle East defense arrangements might be-

come more difficult because of a loss of con-

- 1V, CONSEQUENCES OF A FAILURE OF THE US

TO INTERVENE AGAINST AN OPEN VIET
MINH ATTACK WITHOUT HAVING PRE-
VIOUSLY MADE INTENTIONS CLEARER
THAN THEY ARE AT PRESENT

10. The local reactions to the US failure to
intervene under these conditions would be
virtually the same in Southeast Asia as they

would be under the conditions discussed in ,

Section III above. It is widely believed in

‘Southeast Asia that the US is already com- :

mitted through the Manila Pact to the defense '
of South Vietnam and that it has strong moral '

obligations to the Diem government. How-
ever, if the US had made its intentions no
clearer than at present, the Communists
would be less inclined to believe that the US
failure to intervene indicated that the US
would not resist Communist aggression else-
where. The Communists might therefore pro-
ceed more cautiously in their efforts to exploit
the situation created by the fall of South Viet-
nam. Outside Southeast Asia, the damage to
US prestige and the decline in the will to re-
sist Communist pressure would be less than
under the conditions discussed in Section III

above.

V. CONSEQUENCES OF US ARMED INTERVEN-
TION IF THE US (a) STATED ITS OBJEC-
TIVE WAS LIMITED TO RESTORING THE
STATUS-QUO AT THE 17th PARALLEL, OR
(b) STATED ITS OBJECTIVE WAS TO DE-
STROY THE VIET MINH REGIME AND EX-
TEND NON-COMMUNIST CONTROL TO
ALL VIETNAM

11. Asian and Huropean approval of US armed

intervention against clearly recognizable Com-

munist aggression would be tempered in vary-
ing degrees by the fear that the fighting could
not be limited fo Vietnam. Our NATO allies
and Japan would exert pressure on the US
to limit its objective to restoring the status-
quo and to keep its military actions clearly
consonant with that objective. They would
be deeply concerned if the US declared its ob-
jective to be the destruction of the Viet Minh
regime, or carried the fighting beyond Viet-
nam. India and other neutrals would exert

-every efiort to bring the fighting to an end.

12. The other nations of mainland Southeast
Asia would be encouraged in their efioris
to resist Communist pressure by US inter-
vention. ‘They too, however, would fear thas
the fighting could not be limited to Vietnam.
and that they would become embroiled in gen-
eval war in the Far East. Only Nationalist
China, the ROK, and possibly Thailand ang
the Philippines, would give unqualified sup-.
port to a US declaration that its objective was
to destroy the Viet Minh regime and extend
non-Communist control to all Vietnam.

13. The Communist reactions to US interven-
tion would probably depend on the course of
US military actions rather than on eny state-
ments of US objectives.
