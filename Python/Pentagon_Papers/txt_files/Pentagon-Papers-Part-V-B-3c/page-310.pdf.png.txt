MENT: "DIEM IS A BAD CHOICE, IMPOSSIBLE SOLUTION, WITH NO CHANCE
TO SUCCEED AND NO CHANCE TO IMPROVE THE SITUATION, WITHOUT HIM

SOME SOLUTION MIGHT BE POSSIBLE, BUT WITH HIM THERE IS NONE.

HOWEVER, I CANNOT GUARANTEE ANY OTHER SOLUTION WOULD WORK NOR

IS IT POSSIBLE TO CLARIFY THE SITUATION, THERE SEEMS TO BE
FUNDAMENTAL DISAGREEMENT BETWEEN US, I COULD HAVE CLATMED
THAT SINCE FRENCH POSITION IS PREDOMINANT IN VIETNAM, YOU

SHOULD ACCOMMODATE YOUR VIEWS MORE TO OURS, BUT I HAVE REJECTED
THIS, WHAT SHOULD BE DONE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES? WHAT WOULD
YOU SAY IF WE WERE TO RETIRE ENTIRELY FROM INDOCHINA AND CALL
BACK THE FEC AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. I FULLY REALIZE THIS WOULD BE
A GRAVE SOLUTION, AS IT WOULD LEAVE FRENCH CIVILIANS AND FRENCE
INTERESTS IN A DIFFICULT POSITION, THERE IS ALSO THE QUESTION
OF THE REFUGEES' FATE, IF YOU THINK THIS MIGHT BE A POSSIBLE
SOLUTION, I THINK I MIGHT BE ABLE TO ORIENT MYSELF TOWARDS IT

IF YOU SAY SO. IT WOULD HAVE ADVANTAGE OF AVOIDING ALL FURTHER

REPROACH TO FRANCE OF "COLONIALISM" WHILE AT THE SAME TIME
GIVING RESPONSE TO DIEM'S REQUEST THAT FRANCE SHOULD GO.

SINCE IT CONTIMPLATES THE LIQUIDATION OF THE SITUATION AND THE

REPATRIATION OF THE FEC, WOULD THE UNITED STATES BE DISPOSED

TO HELP PROTECT FRENCH CIVILIANS AND THE REFUGEES? IF YOU DO

NOT AGREE TO THIS SOLUTION AND BELIEVE IT WOULD HAMPER YOU,
THEN WE CAN HAVE FURTHER DISCUSSIONS ON THE VIETNAMESE
SITUATION.
