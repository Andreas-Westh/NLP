d. To withdraw all U.S. support from South Vietnam and
concentrate on saving the remainder of Southeast Asia.

Tneluded in the discussion attached hereto are some cf the
advantages and disadvantages of each course.

4, Although national policy prescribes making every possible
effort to prevent South Vietnam falling to the Communists, the
degree to which the United States is willing to support this
policy in men, money, materials, and acceptance of additional
war risks is not readily apparent. Prior to consideration of
iilitary courses of action with respect to this area, a firm
decision at national level as to implementation of U.S. policy
in Southeast Asia is mandatory. In this connection, the Joint
Chiefs of Staff have recommended previously against a "static”™
defense for this area and therefore reiterate the previously
recommended adoption of a concept of offensive actions against
the "military power of the aggressor".

For the Joint Chiefs of Staff:

ARTHUR RADFORD,

Chairman,
Joint Chiefs of Staff.
