3. Im our view, Goueral Collins! récommendations ignore
the basic factor that we would assist a Communist takeover by a
withholding of our ail, even if it must necessarily be given toa
government which is less than perfect,

_The Secretary has analyzed the situation as one in rhich we
are conducting a time buying operation, If we withhold our support to
VietNam, it will be taken over sooner than if wa extend smaller aid,
at a figure of about a third of last year, In the memtime, we wlll
proceed to do what we can to strengthen Cambodia, Laos aml Thailand.
This is my understanding of the Secretary's policy. :

h, ZI recommend we inform the Secretary end General Collins that
we recogniza the dangers posed by the sbove policy, but that in the
lack of more useful alternatives that we will continus to support Dien,
besause there is no one to take his places who would serve UoS. :
obp ctives any better, This includes the Bao Dai solution which is
opposed by the facts of Bao Daits Jack.of support in Vist-Nam and his
past demonstrations of inability to govern, The fear that a fiscal
commitment of over $300 million plus our national prestige would be
lost in a gamble on the retention of Pree VietNam is a legitimate one,

but the withholding of our support at this juncture would almost
inevitably have a far worseef Clb.

Recomnendation:

That the attached telegram be approved and sens,
