MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

Subject: General Collins' Recommendations Regarding
Military Force Levels in Viet-Nam

~

General Collins has submitted a report and his recommenda-
tions regarding force levels in Viet-Nam. A breakdown of the
proposed forces as recommended is attached as Tab A.

In summary, the main points of his report are as follows:

1. It would be disastrous if the French Expeditionary Corps
were withdrawn prematurely since otherwise Viet-Nam could
be overrun by an enemy attack before the Manila Pact Powers
could act.

2. The United States should continue to subsidize the French
Expeditionary Corps during calendar year 1955, at least to the
degree of one hundred million dollars, to encourage the French
to retain sufficient forces. (The current rate of U.S. subsidy
is four hundred million annually).

3. The Vietnamese National Army, now totaling 170,000
should be reduced by July 1955 to 77,000. It should be placed
under Vietnamese command and control by that date. It
would be organized into six divisions, three of which would
be field elements designed to reinforce the balance of the
Army which would be stationed in regimental and battalion
garrisons throughout the provinces. A small Air Force and
Navy is provided for. The cost to the U.S. would be two
aos million dollars annually. (This is less than current
costs).
