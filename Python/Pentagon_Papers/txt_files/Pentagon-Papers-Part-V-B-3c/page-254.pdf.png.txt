U.S. recognizes that Cao,.Dai and even the Hoa Hao are genuine sects

with evltural religious and political roots which cannot be forcibly torn
up without grave consequences which showla be avoided but we do not believe
that any central government can exist as more then a Aueeneload if it does
not have control over the national police and if this control is fermed out
to a gang which exploits its privileges to protect vice on a yastly profit-
able scale and which exists by virtue of the backing of the self-exiled
Bao Dai and the French. :

We cannot see that replacement of Dien by any persons you mentioned

Will of itself correct this situation and indeed we have had the impression

that Quat was less acceptable to the sects than is Dien.

There are two other factors to be -borne in mind.

One is that it is widely known that Diem has so far existed by reason of
U.S. support despite Freeh reluctance. If, however, when the showdown
comes the French view prevails then that will gravely weakne our influence
for the future both in Vietnam and elsewhere. Removal of Diem under these
circumstances may well be interpreted in Vietnam and Asia as exemple of U.S.
paying lip service to nationalist cause and then forsaking true nationalist
leader when QUOTE colonial interests UNQUOTE put enough pressure on us. The
French constantly assert that the U.S. has a primsry responsibility in this
part of ie world but it is difficult to have responsibility without
acento. In essence, will not the ouster of Diem on the present condi-
tions mean that from now on we will be merely paying the bill end the French
will be calling thé tune. Any successor of Diem will clearly know where

hee it

the real authority lies.
