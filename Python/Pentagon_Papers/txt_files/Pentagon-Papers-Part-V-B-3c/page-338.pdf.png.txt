t Seeretorint is the best
neans of ensuring imnediate action;

>. A study should be made of the conposition, function,
and location of the permanent Secretariat;

ec. The establishnent of such an ad hoe arrangenent should
not prejudice the eventual creation or eyorsrion of a
standing group, or certain sections of a standing nature to

augnent the ad hoe systen, should the need become necessary

because of inadequacies revenled by experience.

2. It was recomended that the Militery Advisers Group
approve the conclusions of this paper and make arrangenents

accordingly.

3. The French Delegation did not accept the recormendetion
nade in this report. It questioned the usefulness at the
present tine of the creation of a permanent secretariat and
held the view that coordinnotion of studies can be satisfactorily
ecrricd out by the Staff Planners at their meetings. If it
was agreed in the future that closer coerdination wes required
it could best be achieved through the tiilitary liaison group
without setting up a new body however small. It also suggested
thnt as a rule a2 hoc committees meet in a few places, centrally
located in the Treaty Ares.

NOTE: The Joint Chiefs of Staff hove no objection to the
establishrent of a small permanent secretariat, which
would be en instrunent of the Military Advisers ond
supordinate planning cormilttees. However, the Joint
Chiefs of Staff would not agree to the possible evoluticn

e
of such a secretariat into an orgmnization of a standing
nature as indicated in subparagraph 1 Â¢ above,*
