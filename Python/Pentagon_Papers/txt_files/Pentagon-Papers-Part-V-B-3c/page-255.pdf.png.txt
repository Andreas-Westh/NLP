The second fawkes is that there will be very strong opposition in
the Congress to supporting the situation in Indochina generally and Vietnan .
in particular if Diem is replaced under existing circiumstances. We do not
say that this opposition may not in fhe Jept duscance be overcome, par-
ticularly if you personally can make a case before the Congressional con-
mittees but Mansfield who is looked wpon with great respect by his cedeacuae:
with reference to this matter, is ademantly opposed to abandonment of Diem
under present conditions. I wonder whether there is not some sutermediate
solution between the present extremes now discussed and that Diem can be
allowed to regain his damaged prestige by an assertion of authority over
the Binh Xuyen and at the seme time other.elements be brought into the
government under conditions which will assure a real delegation of authority.

I feel that as with most Orientals Dien must be highly suspicious of
what is going on about him and that this suspicion exaggerates his natural
disposition to be secretive and untrustful. If he ever really felt meee
the French and ovrselves were solidly behind hin miene he not really broaden
his government? We must I think have some sympathy for his predicament as
he is constantly called QUOTE the Diem experiment UNQUOTE.

In conclusion I want to reaffirm the very great confidence which we
all. have in you and in your judgment. You have done and are doing a wonder-
ful job in the face of tremendous difficulties.
