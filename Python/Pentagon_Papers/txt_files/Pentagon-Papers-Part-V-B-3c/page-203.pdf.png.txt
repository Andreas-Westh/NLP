our MAAG training personnel could be increased beyond the 3542
figure, if it were done quietly and over a period of months.
While I am not a lawyer, I have carefully studied Article 16
of the Geneva agreement with respect to Vietnam and can find
nowhere in this Article any basis for interpretations which
Mendes appears to place on introductions of US training
personnel. Fact is the 342 US total comprised Air Force
technicians and MAAG Logistical personnel. These must be
converted largely to personnel competent to train the

’ Vietnamese Army. on . :
6. After discussing with Radford above details and other
factors concerning Situation here, we were in accord that if NSC
is to Pe-oraleate our policies in late January, to be
followed perhaps by US, British-French consultations, it would
be desirable for me -.to be ‘present Washington during these
Giscussions. Even the best modern communications lack the

§ personel touch and give-and-take exchange of ideas which ~
t would tnink would be essential if. we are to make sound
re-évaluation of our policies with respect to Vietnem.
