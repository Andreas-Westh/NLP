MEMORANDUM FOR THE JOTNT CHIEFS OF STAFF

SUBJECT: Development and Training of Indigenous Forces in Indochina

1. There is attached a letter from the Secretary of State which
refers to two memoranda from the Joint Chiefs of Staff, dated 22 Sep-
tember 1954, on the subjects: “Retention and Develdpment of Forces in
Indochina" and"U.S.: Assumption of Training Responsibilities in Indo-
china." These memoranda were made available to the Department of State
by a letter from the Secretary of Defense, dated 28 September: 1954.

2.. In the attached letter Secretary Dulles raises two related
aspects of the military situation in Indochina: force levels of in-
digenous forces, and U.S, training responsibilities for Vietnamese
forces. He points out certain political considerations which he feels
affect both these subjects. nae

3. In the light of the views expressed in this latest letter
from the Secretary of State, it is requested that the Joint Chiefs of
Staff submit their comments and recommendations with respect to the
levels of forces that should be developed in Viet-Nam, Laos and Cam-
bodia, including their concept of the objectives of such forces from
the U.S. military point of view and an estimate of the annual operat- -
ing cost of training and maintaining such forces.

h, It is further requested that the Joint Chiefs of Staff submit
their comments and recommendations concerning a U.S. commitment to
train Vietnamese forces, in the light of the considerations pointed
out by the Secretary of State in his letter. In view of the special
emphasis placed on an urgent determination of a U.S. course of action .
toward the training question at a meeting of the Operations Coordinat- _
ing Board on 13 October, the views of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on-
this subject are requested as a matter of high priority.
