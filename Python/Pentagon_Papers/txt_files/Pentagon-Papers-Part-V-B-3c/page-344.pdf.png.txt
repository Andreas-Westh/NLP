COURSES OF ACTION

To estimate the deterrent efiect on the Viet Minh of certain US courses of ac-

. tion; to assess the consequences of a US failure to counter overt Viet Minh agegres-

sion? and to assess the political repercussions of US armed intervention against Viet

Minh aggression.

THE ESTIMATE

Il. INTRODUCTORY NOTE

i. We continue to regard as valid the estimate
made in NIE 63.1-55, namely that during the
period of the estimate (to July 1958) “concern
for Western and particularly US reactions,
together with general considerations arising
from over-all Bloc policy, will prevent the DRV
We also
believe that the present Communist policy of
reducing international tension makes unlikely
the resort to overt aggression.

TARY, POLITICAL, AND ECONOMIC STEPS

NiSTS THAT OVERT AGGRESSION BY THE
VIET MINH AGAINST SOUTH VIETNAM

US ARMED INTERVENTION

2. This assumed US course of action would

render even less likely than at present any

overt ageression by the Viet Minh against

South Vietnam. The Comraunists would prob-

*“Acoression” in this paper is defined as a Viet
Minh attack by overt armed forces across the
armistice line, of such a character that it can
clearly be labeled as aggression and is generally
regarded as such by free world opinion.

in the face of swift and determined US atmed
intervention; (b) Chinese Communist assist-

seriously risk spreading the war beyond Viet-

other means and believed they enjoyed a
marked superiority in forces locally available,

3. The assumed US course of action would not’

in itself preclude either a Communist decision

to initiate large-scale guerrilla action in South -

Vietnam or the clandestine support of such
actions by the Viet Minh.

4, The deterrent effect on the Communists of
the assumed course of action would be jin-
increased if the US made it clear that nuclear
weapons would be used. If the US made it
clear that nuclear weapons would not be useq
the deterrent effect would be reduced. How-
ever, the Communists would probably estj-
mate that the US would not maintain such a
position if faced with a deteriorating Military
Situation. In the absence of any clear indica.
tion, the Communisis would almost certainly
base their plans on the possibility that nucleay
weapons would be used.
