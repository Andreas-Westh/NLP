THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF

Washington 25, D.C.

21 January 1955

MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE

Subject: Reconsideration of U.S. Military Programs
in Southeast Asia.

1. In response to your memorandum, dated 5 January 1955,
subject as above, the Joint Chiefs of Staff submit the fol-
lowing views and recommendations.

2. In answer to the eight specific points raised in the
above memorandum, the Joint Chiefs of Staff consider it ap-
propriate, in view of the complexity of the problem and the
difficulty of considering any of the questions in isolation,
to forward a discussion of the points raised. This discussion
is attached as the Appendix hereto.

3. The Joint Chiefs of Staff consider that the eight points
mentioned involve only a portion of the over-all problem in an
examination of the implications of possible courses of action.
Accordingly, in response to your request to submit views and
recommendations on any other points considered appropriate,
the following courses of action are considered available to the
United States in the light of the current situation in South
Vietnam.

a. To continue aid to South Vietnam as currently being
developed with the cooperation of the French and Vietnamese.

b. To institute a unilateral program of direct guidance
to the Vietnamese government through an "advisory" system.
Under this course of action, the amount of U.S. aid should
be dependent upon Vietnamese adherence to U.S. direction.

Â¢. In the event the courses of action in subparagraphs
a and b above, are not sufficient to insure retention of
South Vietnam to the Free World, to deploy self-sustaining
U.S. forces to South Vietnam, either unilaterally, or as a
part of a Manila Pact force.
