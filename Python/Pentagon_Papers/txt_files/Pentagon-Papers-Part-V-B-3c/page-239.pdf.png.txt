You should speak to Diem privately regarding elections, without
showing him formula outlined next telegram. We are not now attenpting
egeure his approval as such to ovr position but to assure he understands
our viewpoint and accepts it to degree = can proceed with French British
ee broad assumption Free Viet-Nam's position similar our own.

Believe best way accomplish this is to remind him of his and foreign
ministers Pipertet ious with Secretary on this isecs and to continue that
in specific cases of elections in Korea and Germany Free World has stood
firm on issue of guarantees of genuine free elections, supervised by body
then tag â€œeben oy guarantee elements free elections PAREN outlined last
paragraph following telegram UNPAREN. In, each case Communists have refused
kecent these safesuards which we think basic and fundemental. We believe
unless such guarantees pieiousls agreed upon would be dangerous for Free
Viet-Nem be drawn into further discussions of other issues of gieetioa.
Ask Diem if we can assume our thinking is alike on this point.

Since time exceedingly important, hope we can have affirmative answer

soonest.
