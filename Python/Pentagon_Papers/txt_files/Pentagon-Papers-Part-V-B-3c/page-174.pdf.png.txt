-k- FROM PARIS, WYPQ DECEMBER 19, 4PM SECTION ONE’ OF TWO

IN SPITE OF THIS FACT, HE STILL REPRESENTED LEGALITY AND
COULD SERVE IN FUTURE IF “LEGALITY” HAD TO BE PROVIDED TO AN

STEP WE WOULD WISH TO TAKE.

MENDES THEN SPOKE OF A PLAN FRENCH HAVE BEEN CONSIDERING. .
FIRST PHASE WAS TO ASK BAO DAI TO PLACE ON SPOT IN VIETNAM -

A REPRESENTATIVE WHO WOULD EXERCISE BAO DAL’S AUTHORITY.

HE WOULD BE "DELEGATE" OR VICEROY. HE WOULD HAVE FULL AUTHORITY
TO USE BAO DAI*S POWERS. USEFULNESS WOULD PERSIST EVEN IF

DIEM SHOULD SUCCEED FOR HE COULD ACT AS SUPREME ARBITRATOR

TO SETTLE. SQUABBLES. :

MENDES SAID THAT FRENCH WERE NOW PREPARED TALK TO BAO DAI
ALONG THESE LINES AND URGE HIM ESTABLISH VICEROY WITHOUT DELAY.

FRENCH ALSO PROPOSED APPROACH BAO DAI WITH VIEW REINFORCING
PRESENT GOVT AND PREPARING LEGAL GROUNDS FOR NEW ONE IF IT
SHOULD BE FOUND NECESSARY,

EDEN INTERVENED TO STATE: THAT IN HIS OPINION IT WOULD BE MISTAKE
FOR BAO DAI TO GO BACK NOW BUT BRITISH RECOGNIZED ADVANTAGE

OF VIETNAMESE ROYAL TRADITION AND AGREED THAT “ROYAL CONMISSION*
OF SOME SORT SHOULD BE SET UP AND MIGHT PROVE BE BEST WAY OUT.

HE INQUIRED ABOUT PERSONALITY AND USEFULNESS OF EMPRESS AND
MENDES REPLIED THAT SHE WAS EXEMPLARY PERSON WHO COULD PROVE
VERY USEFUL IN VIETNAM.
