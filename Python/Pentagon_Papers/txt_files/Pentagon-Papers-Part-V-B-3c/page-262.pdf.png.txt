OPINION AND CREATING AN ATMOSPHERE IN WHICH SECTS CAN BE
INDUCED ACCEPT PEACEFUL SOLUTION, PROBLEM COULD HAVE BEEN
RESOLVED MORE BASILY AT AN EARLIER TIME, QUAT SAID HE DID
NOT THINK DIEM AND ANY TEAM HE MIGHT GATHER COULD RESUME
EFFECTIVE CONTACT WITH SECTS.

4, QUAT DISCUSSED IN A GENERALLY UNFAVORABLE SENSE DO'S
IDEA OF HAVING BAO DAI CONVOKE A CONGRESS. HE SATD THE
CONGRESS WOULD BE MORE QUICKLY SET UP THAN A PROVISIONAL
ASSEMBLY AND WOULD BE MORE MANAGEABLE. HOWEVER, OWING TO
BAO DAT'S ABSENCE IN FRANCE, PRESENT POLITICAL ROLES: OF
SECTS AND ATTITUDE OF OTHER POLITICAL GROUPS, HE BELIEVED
CONGRESS NOT PRACTICABLE, QUAT SAID HE THOUGH THE BEST
SOLUTION WOULD BE PROVIDED BY A.PROVISIONAL ASSEMBLY, BUT
POLITICAL GROUPS ARE FEARFUL OF ANY ASSEMBLY CONSTITUTED
UNDER DIEM AS PRIME MINISTER,

5. DO SAID THAT IN HIS VIEW MEANS SHOULD BE FOUND TO ALLOW
VIETNAMESE PUBLIC OPINION TO BE HEARD. HE HAD SUGGESTED
CONGRESS AS A MEANS TO THAT END, IF THERE WERE AN ASSEMBLY
PRESENT, CRISIS COULD BE MORE EASILY RESOLVED. A CONGRESS,
OPERATING UNDER BINH XUYEN MENACE, MIGHT REMOVE DIEM AND
THIS COULD BE INTERPRETED AS VICOTRY FOR SECTS WITH
UNFORTUNATE EFFECTS IN U.S. DO SUGGESTED AS POSSIBILITY
THAT CONGRESS BE REPRESENTATIVE ONLY OF POLITICAL GROUPS AND
WOT REPEAT NOT OF SECTS, IF PROVISIONAL ASSEMBLY SOLUTION
WERE ADOPTED, IT WOULD BE NECESSARY FIND INTERIM GOVERNMENT
TO FUNCTION FOR PERIOD OF PERHAPS SIX WEEKS AND THUS PROBLEM
REMAINS OF CREATING A NEW GOVERNMENT. DIEM IS A BARRIER TO
SOLUTION OF THIS PROBLEM. DO REFERRED TO FACT THAT DURING
NINE YEARS OF WAR NO GOVERNMENT COULD OBTAIN POPULAR SUPPORT
FOR STRUGGLE AGAINST COMMUNISM BECAUSE THEY WERE ALL FRENCH
PUPPET GOVERNMENTS. PROBLEM NOW IS TO GAIN POPULAR SUPPORT
TO CONTINUE RESISTANCE TO VIET MINH. DIEM'S GOVERNMENT HAS
NOT SUCCEEDED IN CONVINCING PEOPLE OR POLITICAL GROUPS OF
NECESSITY TO CARRY ON ANTI-VIET MINH STRUGGLE. ONLY A
GOVERNMENT FULLY SUPPORTED BY PEOPLE CAN DO THAT, AND SUCH
A GOVERNMENT MUST COME FROM SOME KIND OF POPULAR BODY,”
EITHER AN ASSEMBLY OR A CONGRESS. AS A PRACTICAL TEST OF
WHETHER PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT FOLLOWED BY PROVISIONAL
ASSEMBLY WOULD BE ACCEPTABLE SOLUTION, DO SUGGESTED ASKING
SPECIFIC INDIVIDUALS, SUCH AS QUAT AND MINH, WHETHER THEY
