LIMIT DISTRIBUTION

_ FYI. We have been working on problem of elections in Viet-Nam, in great

detail over last several weeks. NSC has asked Department submit policy
for consideration by sala and we sure that elections will be discussed
during proposed U.S.-French ta aes Washington April 20. The British have
offered give us their views on elections prior these talks.

We feel best solution is for us be in position inform French British

our views prior talks and believe it best we can put such forward as support

of policy of Free Viet-Nam rather than es unilateral U.S. recommendations.

Our proposal is based on Eden's plan put forward at Berlin-Conference
for all. German elections and has already been approved by France for =e
Germany and rejected by the Communists. The basic principle is that Free
Viet-Nam will insist to the Viet Minh that wmless agreement is first reached
by the latter's acceptence of the safeguards spelled out, that no repeat no further
discussions are possible regarding the type of elections, the issues to be
voted on or any other factors.

After we have Diem's general acceptance we can proceed inform UK and
France of cube plan which We: Baie only formula which ensures both satisfac.
tory response to Geneva Agreenent end at same time plan which is unassailable
in intent but probably unecceptable to Communists because of provisions for

strict compliance to ensure genuinely free elections, END FYI,
