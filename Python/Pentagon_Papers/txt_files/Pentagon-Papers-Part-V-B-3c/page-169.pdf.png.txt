1, The’ situation in Viete-Nam at the time of General Collins?
arrival on Noverber 7 might be described as follows
_A. The French had lest a disastrous battle at Dien Bien Phu and
that Conminist military victory had been compoumled by a humiliating
diplonatic defeat for the Free World at Geneva, The Communists had
achieved a level of international recognition and position througa
these develonments far exceeding any previous status,

B. Ngo Dinh Diem took office on July 7. He was the first
WWationalist" to assume the Prima Ministership, He was and is, anti=
French, anti-Commmnist and personally honest, He is politically inept,
stubborn and suspicious, In his four months of responsibility he
had bsen faced with massive opposition, including a rebellious Arnuy
Chief who allegedly was an unwitting tool of the Communists, active
French opposition and many other discouraging factors.

C. There is every evidence that the Freneh did not want Diem to |
succesd, Reluctant acceptance by Ia Charbre (Septerber) and Mendes=
France (Noverber) of tho U.S, thasis of support of Dien,, principally
because of the lack of a better qualified candidate, may have eased

French pressures against im but did not result in full French support,

2’, Since General Collinst arrival, the latter has attempted to
echieve a rapid solution, at least partially based on the cenespt that
Collins! mission is temporary and a settlemeat appeared called for by
the time of his originally scheduled departure in mid-January, (Since
extended). General Collins! recommendations are now based on the cire
cunstances of a satisfactory settlement prior to January 1. If no

solution-is found, he recomnendss

&, Continucd suoport of Diem for a short period but
without committing specific U.S. aid programs,

‘be Recalling Bao Dai, if acceptable to US.

Co Revaluation of our plens for assisting Southeast Asia,

do’ If the situation continues without substantial progressive

action to withhold support to the Viet<Non Army and to increase
support of the French Expeditionary Corps thile evacuating our
MDAP materiel,
