Your assistance in (a) making it somehow possible to
bring in additional personnel, and (b) arranging with the
French for effective implementation of the Collins-Ely
Minute of Understanding is requested -on an urgent basis.

I recognize that in reaching your conclusions, you must also
weight other factors not discussed in this letter. To enable
the Department of Defense to carry out its responsibilities
in Free Viet-Nam, however, a solution along the lines
discussed above is essential.

The Honorable

Sincerely yours,

SIGNED

C.E. WILSON

The Secretary of State
