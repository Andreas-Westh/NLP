In this current political Crisis involving the strucels ore

ar

between President Diem and General Hinh, General O'Daniel ha
quite understandably been deeply, concerned. He has taken a
position ne while he recognizes the faults and shortcomings
of General Hinh, he still believes him to be the best soldier
available to the Vietnamese to head uv their National Army.
This is not the view of General Ely or his most experienced’
and objective observers who see General Vy as preferable be-
cause of his character and exnerience, although lacking in
Hinhts vivacity of intelligence. At the same time, being a

man of action himself, General O'Daniel is impatient with the
hesitancy and wealmess of the Diem Government. It is not my
purpose to comment upon these views, which are held in some
measure by the Sabassy as well. “Tac vrobdlem arises in the
Generalts tendency to velisve that all matters can be- portrayed
in sharp black and white and can be solved by forthright and
direct action. General O'Daniel is handicapped by his own
straightforwardness and none sty of ‘character. which make him <.
an easy target for those who wish to take him in, and by an
unfortunate impression that he is a master of tact and mile. .>
