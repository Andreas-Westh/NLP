ment, the development of stability in Cam-
' bodia during the next year or so will depend
‘ largely on two interrelated factors:.(a) the
ability of the Cambodians to develop effective
government and internal security forces; and
(b) the ability of the Cambodians to obtain
external technical and financial assistance.
There is no prohibition in the Geneva agree-
ments against Cambodia’s obtaining outside
assistance to develop its defense forces or on
joining a defensive alliance, providing the lat-
ter is in consonance with the UN Charter and
that no foreign troops are based in Cambodia

in the absence of a threat to Cambodian se-

curity. If adequate outside assistance is
miade available, the Cambodians will probably
increase the effectiveness both of their gov-
ernment and their internal security forces,
and will be able to suppress Communist guer-
rilla activity-and to counter Communist polit-

ical activity. The efforts of the Cambodians

to strengthen their position would probably

be more energetic if their independence were

guaranteed by some regional defense arrange-
ment. The situation in Cambodia would de-
teriorate gravely, however, if a Communist
government should emerge in Laos or South
Vietnam. :
