PROBABLE DEVEL

PMENTS IN NORTH VIETNAM

TO JULY -1958

(Supersedes Portions of NIE 63—-7-54 on North Vietnam)

‘THE PR

BLEM

To analyze the present strengths and weaknesses of North Vietnam and to esti-
mate probable future developments and trends to July 1956.

CONCLUSIONS

1. The immediate concern of the “Demo-

cratic Republic of Vietnam” (DRV) is to.

consolidate its control in the area north

-of the 17th Parallel and to gain control

of South Vietnam. (Para. 14)

2. We believe that the DRV will experi-
ence no great difficulty in maintaining
efiective control of North Vietnam during
the period of this estimate and will prob-
ably retain a considerable measure of
prestige and general acceptance. How-
ever, passive resistance and discontent
resuiting from harsh control] measures
and poor economic conditions may in-
crease toward the end of the period. If
the situation in the South does not de-
teriorate, the nationalist appeal of Ho Chi
Minh and the DRV wil: probably be re-
duced throughout Vietnam, (Para. 23)
3. The DRV is confronted by serious eco-
nomic problems of which the current rice
shortage is the most critical. Its present

xport potential falls far short of pro-

viding sufiicient funds to pay for neces-

See

sgry, imports. However, the Sino-Soviet
Bloc ‘will almost certainly provide sufii-
cient economic and technical assistance
to meet minimum reguirements for ‘sta-
bility and control. With such assistance
the DRV will probably make egradual

progress in gaining control of the econ--

omy and in rehabilitating transporta-

tion, irrigation, and industrial facilities,

(Paras. 24-30)

4. Since. the Geneva Conference, the
strength of the DRV regular army has

een increased substantially by drawing
on regional forces to form new units and
by the receipt of new and heavier mili:
tary equipment from Communist China.
DRvV forces are capable of Gefeating al)
military forces, including the French,

now located in South Vietnam, Laos, and }

(Paras. 31-35)

5. The present DRYV tactic with respect
to South Vietnam is to pose as the
champion of Vietnamese Independence
and unification, and as the defender. o?

Cambodia.
