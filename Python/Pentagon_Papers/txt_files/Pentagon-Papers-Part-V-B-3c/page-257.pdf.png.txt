-2- 4396, APRIL 9, 5 PM (SECTION ‘THREE OF FOUR), FROM PARIS

THE EXECUTIVE ROLE OF GOVERNING THE COUNTRY BEFORE IT IS TOO
LATE, WE ASKED HIM TO BE MORE PRECISE AND HE STATED THAT HE
HAD IN MIND A FORM OF "SUPREME COUNCIL" OR “COUNCIL OF ELDERS"
WHICH WOULD SERVE AS A GOVERNING BODY. IT WOULD FUNCTION UNDER
BAO DAL'S OVERALL DIRECTION AS CHIEF OF STATE, BUT WOULD EN-
JOY THE SAME POWERS NOW ENJOYED BY DIEM. BAO DAT'S CHIEF
F'NCTION WOULD BE THAT OF "SUPREME ARBITRATOR". THE COUNCIL
ULD HAVE TO INCLUDE, IF IT WERE TO BE EFFECTIVE, REPRE-
SENTATION OF ALL (ann) FACTIONS IN VIETNAM INCLUDING THE
CATHOLICS WHO MIGHT DECIDE THAT DIEM IS THE BEST QUALIFIED MAN
T) REPRESENT THEM. WE ASKED WHETHER IT WAS THOUGHT THAT THE
( JUNCIL WOULD REPLACE THE GOVERNMENT OR SIMPLY ACT IN CON-
JUNCTION WITH IT AND DE SAID THAT FOR THE MOMENT HE THOUGHT
THAT BAO DAT'S THOUGHTS WERE ALONG THE LATTER LINES BUT
THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE WORKED OUT. THE ONE RESTRICTION OF
MEMBERSHIP IN THE COUNCIL SHOULD BE THAT ALL ITS MEMBERS
BE ANTI-COMMUNIST.

WE ASKED WHETHER BAO DAT HAD ANY VIEWS ON RETURNING TO VIETNAM
AND WERE TOLD THAT HE HAD NONE FOR THE MOMENT BUT WAS
PREPARED TO DO ANYTHING THAT WE AND THE FRENCH FELT WOULD HELP
TOWARD A SOLUTION TO THE CRISIS. DE STATED THAT BAO DAT HAD
WANTED TO RETURN MANY TIMES DURING RECENT MONTHS WHEN IT
BECAME MORE AND MORE CLEAR THAT DIEM WAS INCAPABLE OF GOVERN-
ING BUT THAT HE HAD BEEN PREVENTED FROM DOING SO BY DIEM HIM-

_ SELF WHO ARGUED THAT THE UNITED STATES WAS OPPOSED TO BAO
DAL'S RETURN AND THAT IT WOULD BE INADVISABLE FOR HIM TO COME
BACK FOR THERE WAS GREAT OPPOSITION TO HIM IN VIETNAM AND
THAT HE, DIEM, WAS "PRESERVING BAO DAL'S INTEREST". BAO
DAI WAS NOT IMPRESSED BY ANY OF THESE ARGUMENTS EXCEPT THAT
THE UNITED STATES DID NOT WISH HIM TO RETURN, WHICH WAS
CONFIRMED TO HIM BY LA CHAMBRE, HE HAD NOT PRESSED THE
ISSUE BECAUSE HE FELT THAT, AS IN THE HINH CASE, HE MIGHT
ACTUALLY WIELD MORE INFLUENCE FROM AFAR WHERE HE WAS REMOVED
FROM PETTY LOCAL SQUABBLES AND COULD EXERCISE HIS AUTHORITY
FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT AS HE HAD IN THE
HINH CASE,
