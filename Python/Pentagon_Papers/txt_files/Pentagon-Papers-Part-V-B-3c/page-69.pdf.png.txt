12. The Joint Chiefs of Staff concur in the opinion that the
security treaty itself should be drafted by a working group
representing all of the probable initial signatories. Subject
to the comments contained hereinbefore, the informal and un-
official first United States draft, furnished by your memorandum
for the Joint Chiefs of Staff dated 22 July 1954, is considered
to be satisfactory as a point of departure. However, several
of the technical points raised by the United h:ngdom side of the
Study Group appear to merit favorable consideration.

13. It would appear desirable to keep the Japanese Govern-
ment advised as to the progress of treaty negotiations.

14. It is recommended that the foregoing views be given due
consideration in the formulation of the Department of Defense
position in connection with further negotiations concerning a
collective security organization for the general area of South-
east Asia and the Southwest Pacific.

15. It is requested that the Joint Chiefs of Staff be afforded
additional opportunities, as appropriate, to submit comments
concerning the draft treaty in the course of its development.

For the Joint Chiefs of Staff:

M. B. RIDGWAY,
General, United States Army,
Chief of Staff.
