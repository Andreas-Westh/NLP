1 OF U.S. POLICY IN THE FAR ES LS?

PREFACE

Consecuences of the Geneve Conference

Ui oe eye a tS Gee VUES ee

Communist successes in Dey, aiinaneting ‘in the
agreement reached at the Geneva Conference, have produced the
following significant conseguences which jeopardize the
security interests of the U,. 'S. in the Far Fast and increase
Communist strength there:

a. Regardless of the fate of South Vietnam, Laos
and Cambodia, the Communists have secured possession of
an advance salient in Vietnen from which military and
non-military pressures can be mounted against adjacent
and more remote non-Communist areas,

b, The loss of prestige in Asie suffered by the
U.S. as a backer of the French and the Pao Dai Government
will raise further doubts in Asia concerning U.S. leader-
ship and the ability of the U.S. to check the further
expansion of Communism in Asia. Furthermore, U.S.
prestige will inescapably be associated with subsequent
developments in Southeast Asia,

Ce BY adopting an appearance of moderation at
Geneva and taking credit for the cessation of hostilities
in Ii.dochina, the Communists will be in a better position,
. ‘to-exploit tneir political strategy of imputing to the

oe United States motives of extremism, bDelligerency, and

. opposition to co-existence seeking thereby to alienate
the U.S. from its allies, The Communists thus heave a
-basis for sharply accentu uating their "peace propaganda"!
and "peace progran"™ in Asis in an attempt to allay fears
of Communist e2 xpansionist policy and to establisn closer
relations with tne nations of free Asia.
