-2- 4448, APRIL 9, 10 P.M. (SECTION 4 OF 5) FROM SAIGON

TO DEFECT, SUCH INCIDENTS, WOULD HAVE VERY LIMITED EFFECT

ON BULK OF ARMY, IT SHOULD BE SAID HERE THAT UNDER NO
CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD GENERAL MINH BE ALLOWED RETURN TO VIET
NAM NOW. HE RETAINS CONSIDERABLE INFLUENCE IN ARMY AND COULD -
BECOME ONCE AGAIN MAJOR DISRUPTIVE INFLUENCE.

4. COMPILATION OF ASSETS OF STRENGTH DIEM MAY HAVE IS
DIFFICULT TO MAKE. WITH RESPECT TO POLITICAL FOLLOWING IN
CENTER VIET NAM, THIS HAS BEEN FALLING OFF PARTLY AS RESULT
OF POLITICAL ACTIVITIES OF DIEM'S BROTHER NGO DINH CAN,

AND OPPOSITION HAS TAKEN FORM FOR EXAMPLE OF RECENT INCIDENTS
AT BA LANG. THERE IS NO PROPER GRASS ROOTS SUPPORT OF ANY
LEADER IN VIET NAM, LEAVING ASIDE HO CHI MINH, DIEM'S
VIRTUES AS ANTI-FRENCH LEADER HAVE BEEN TARNISHED BY HIS
DEPENDENCE ON HIS BROTHERS WHICH HAS LED TO QUITE GENERAL
FEELING THAT A NGO FAMILY DICTATORSHIP IS IN EFFECT BEING
ESTABLISHED, FEW NATIONALISTS OUTSIDE HIS FAMILY AND IMMEDIATE
ENTOURAGE WOULD LIF A FINGER IN DIEM'S DEFENSE. HOW GREAT
HIS FOLLOWING IS IN CATHOLIC COMMUNITY IS HARD TO SAY.

DIEM HIMSELF CLAIMS HIS SUPPORT IN CENTER, FOR EXAMPLE,
COMES LARGELY FROM NON-CATHOLICS. IN ANY EVENT CATHOLIC
COMMUNITY IS NOT POLITICALLY ORGANIZED AND REPRESENTS LESS
THAN 10 PERCENT OF POPULATION, CERTAINLY MANY REFUGEES FROM
NORTH WERE ATTRACTED BY FACT CATHOLIC HEADS GOVERNMENT OF
SOUTH, BUT POLITICAL AND PHYSICAL STRENGTH OF REFUGEES IS
ONLY A POTENTIAL FOR EXPLOITATION AT A LATER DATE. IN
NATIONAL ARMY, SCARCELY ANY LEADERS ARE ENTIRELY PRO-DIEM,
EVEN CHIEF OF STAFF TY; SOME ARE HOSTILE, AND THE MAJORITY
ARE PROBABLY NO MORE THAN LUKE-WARM, I BELIEVE THERE IS NO
REASON TO ANTICIPATE SERIOUS ADVERSE REACTION IN ARMY AT
LARGE. IF DIEM IS REMOVED THROUGH ORDERLY PROCESSES.

5. VIET MINH REACTION TO DIEM'S REMOVAL WOULD UNDOUBTEDLY
BE TO EFFECT THAT FREE WORLD HAD SUFFERED DAMAGING SETBACK.
APART FROM STEPPED-UP PROPAGANDA CAMPAIGN AND PUBLIC GLOATING
OVER DEFEAT OF AN ENEMY, I DO NOT BELIEVE VIET MINH REACTION
WOULD BE DANGEROUS. IN OTHER WORDS, I DO NOT ANTICIPATE

VIET MINH WOULD ATTEMPT TAKE MILITARY ADVANTAGE OF DIEM'S
REMOVAL. HOWEVER, VIET MINH, PLAYING MANY ANGLES AS USUAL,
MIGHT ATTEMP. BUILD.UP ANTI-FRENCH AND ANTI-U.S. SENTIMENT,
CHARGING OVERTHROW OF NATIONALIST GOVERNMENT TO FRENCH AND
U.S. â€œIMPERTALISTS."
